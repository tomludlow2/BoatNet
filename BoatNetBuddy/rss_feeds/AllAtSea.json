In addition, they’re offering a knot bag for every order over £30 during the show weekend.

This range is developed in conjunction with the world’s best sailors, including the British Sailing Team, and helps ensure success at every level of dinghy sailing. Speak to the Marlow team on stand 172.\nCover all your ILCA set up needs with Performance Sailcraft Europe (stand 314) where they’re offering Harken Outhauls and Vangs (complete or lines only) and a complete Ronstan 8:1 Downhaul.\nThe Pad-Tii from Allen/P&B\nTop of the blocks\nTickle up your Topper with a choice of six meticulously curated race packs from Allen Brothers (stand 6) utilising high-performance components such as dynamic blocks, Tii-on blocks and aluminium cam cleats as well as high-performance British-made rope, which is pre-cut or spliced to the required lengths. The packs are completely class-legal and can be used for competition and training, with a 30% show discount available on the Allen stand.\nP&B (stand 4) are offering Harken’s Zircon blocks – described as their most efficient small boat blocks, featuring industrial ceramic ball bearings in caged races for ultra-low friction. Over 700% stronger than stainless, they stay smooth and won’t deform under load. Their responsiveness in light air allows precise sail trim, improving sail shape and boosting speed.\nYou can also check out Allen’s Tii-Bone connector on the P&B stand. A lightweight but robust connector designed for performance sailing, the Tii-Bone range streamlines rigging for halyards, sheets, and control lines. Crafted from anodised marine-grade aluminium, it’s lightweight, durable, and corrosion-resistant and is user-friendly for all skill levels making it an essential addition to any sailor’s kit.\nLooking for a secure, flexible through-deck fitting?

It can be fitted without any permanent modification to your boat, rigged in a couple of minutes, launched with the sail down and can be stored under the boat cover. Check it out on stand 114.\nTechnology Zone\nA new show feature for 2025, the Technology Zone will showcase various equipment influencing race operations and dinghy sailing, from; Robotic ‘MarkSetBot’ race marks, tracking and scoring from SailRacer, mobile phone tracking from GeoRacing through to onboard tech such as the Velocitek ProStart and Cyclops load sensors, to name but a few.\nThe technology will all be on display with additional information and the opportunity to interact and learn more about it, so go and check it out.

World-class diving and snorkelling in Thailand</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Take a plunge at Ko Racha Yai’s submerged sculpture park to come face to face with giant stone elephants and incredible underwater art. The wrecks, reefs, and rays leave you beaming all while enjoying visibility up to 30 meters.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Want something more private and exclusive? Located within the less-travelled Surin Islands, Richelieu Rock is part of the UNESCO-protected Marine National Park. The underwater paradise is riddled with magnificent views and unspoiled reefs, but without question, the most notable reason for putting Richelieu Rock at the top of your holiday bucket list is the strong whale shark presence. In fact, this region is often referred to as “whale shark territory” by diving enthusiasts. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdgkMUJmvvjq6fV9mOqo9gYLDnY7auLmX072zDT2NQG5nTpvHVX7ijlEKtV2AVAMCrsA39O5JjbTWJ27vF2VFF31_d53cQ-oEbWO0qVG2pNztEtug9NLbLHcs39-BJhvzEP0_iQZQ?key=BDRK07eDWzfEBRRmB6TwLiIW\" width=\"377\" height=\"503\" /></span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2.

You’ll have the chance to hand-pick the perfect pearl accessory to commemorate your holiday at one of the charming neighbouring shops.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>6. Phang Nga Bay</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Prepare to be astonished by this secluded bay, famous for its dreamy emerald-green waters, towering limestone pillars, and tangled mangrove forests.
