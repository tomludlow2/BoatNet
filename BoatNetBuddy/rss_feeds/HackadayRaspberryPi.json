The paint job on the display is great, but the stripes on the keyboard and badging on are on another level. Be sure to check out the entire gallery on this one.</p>\n<p>About that keyboard &#8212; [John] started this project with two incomplete keyboards that each had a couple of broken switches. Since the two keyboards were compliments of each other parts-wise, they made a great pair, and [John] only had to swap out three switches to get it up and clacking.</p>\n<p>In order to make it work with the Pi, <a href=\"https://github.com/racerxr650r/SerKey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">[John] wrote a user-mode serial driver</a> that uses the uinput kernel module to inject key events to the kernel. But he didn&#8217;t stop there.</p>\n<p>Although the Pi supports composite video out, the OS doesn&#8217;t provide any way to turn off the chroma color signal that&#8217;s modulated on top of the basic monochrome NTSC signal, which makes the picture look terrible. To fix that, <a href=\"https://github.com/racerxr650r/pivec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">he wrote a command-line app</a> that sets up the video controller to properly display a monochrome NTSC signal.

This here is an industrial key switch force tester. [ThereminGoat] is gonna tell you all about <a href=\"https://www.theremingoat.com/blog/a-better-beginners-guide-to-force-curves\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">force curves and how to read them</a>.</p>\n<p>What even is a force curve, and why is it so important? It refers to the graphical representation of the force required to press a key to the actuation point (y) versus the distance traveled during the press (x). So, it&#8217;s only critical to evaluating key switch performance. Key points along the force curve include the starting force, the actuation point, the tactile bump if present, the bottom-out force, and the return curve.</p>\n<p>So, why does it actually matter? Force curves help us understand how light or heavy a switch feels, the actuation behavior, and help with customization.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "What do you get when you combine a Raspberry Pi 4B, a Kaypro keyboard, and a 9″ Apple ], you get the coolest AVR development workstation I’ve seen in a while.\nImage by [John Anderson] via Hackaday.IOAs you may have guessed, I really dig the looks of this thing. The paint job on the display is great, but the stripes on the keyboard and badging on are on another level. Be sure to check out the entire gallery on this one.\nAbout that keyboard — [John] started this project with two incomplete keyboards that each had a couple of broken switches. Since the two keyboards were compliments of each other parts-wise, they made a great pair, and [John] only had to swap out three switches to get it up and clacking.\nIn order to make it work with the Pi, [John] wrote a user-mode serial driver that uses the uinput kernel module to inject key events to the kernel. But he didn’t stop there.\nAlthough the Pi supports composite video out, the OS doesn’t provide any way to turn off the chroma color signal that’s modulated on top of the basic monochrome NTSC signal, which makes the picture look terrible. To fix that, he wrote a command-line app that sets up the video controller to properly display a monochrome NTSC signal. Happy AVRing on your amazing setup, [John]!\nCheck Out This Refreshingly Small Keyboard\nImage by [AnnaRooks] via redditUsually when we see keyboards this small, they have tiny keys that are fully intended for thumb presses and thumb presses only. But what about something ultra-portable that has full-size keys?\nAlthough it might be hard to believe, [AnnaRooks] only uses about 20 of the 24 keys that make up this mint tin keyboard. She has a keymap for typing, gaming, and Diablo II.\nPersonally, and my feelings about layers aside, I don’t think I could use a keyboard without thumb clusters at this point. Although you know what? It would make a great traveling macropad.\nThe Centerfold: A Close Look At Force Curves\nImage by [ThereminGoat] via redditWell, boys and girls, we’ve got a smart beauty this time around. This here is an industrial key switch force tester. [ThereminGoat] is gonna tell you all about force curves and how to read them.\nWhat even is a force curve, and why is it so important? It refers to the graphical representation of the force required to press a key to the actuation point (y) versus the distance traveled during the press (x). So, it’s only critical to evaluating key switch performance.

Force curves help us understand how light or heavy a switch feels, the actuation behavior, and help with customization. I’ll let [ThereminGoat] take it from here.\nDo you rock a sweet set of peripherals on a screamin’ desk pad? Send me a picture along with your handle and all the gory details, and you could be featured here!\nHistorical Clackers: My IBM Wheelwriter 5\nYou know, I kind of can’t believe that I’ve now gone 47 Keebins without spotlighting my daily driver, which takes up most of my second desk.
