Known for its shimmering blue wings, the Morpho butterfly owes its brilliance not to pigments but to microscopic structures that manipulate light. Now, researchers are harnessing those same structures to gain detailed insights into the fibrous makeup of cancer biopsy samples—without the need for chemical staining or expensive imaging equipment.",
