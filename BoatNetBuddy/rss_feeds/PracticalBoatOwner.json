You will need more and longer lines than your normal complement. <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/seamanship/berthing-a-vessel-2-clever-ways-with-warps-80890\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Warps</a> need to reach up and around lock bollards, which may be set well back from the edge, and then back down to you. Mooring bollards or rings on quays are often designed for barges and may be a long way apart. We bought our ropes from boat jumbles.</p>\n<p><strong>A rope-cutting knife</strong></p>\n<p>When going up or down in a lock there is always the potential for a warp to get jammed. The tension on it can become frightening as your boat is either being dragged underwater or suspended from the lockside. It’s essential to have a good <a href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/gear/best-boat-knife-11-options-tried-and-tested-87366\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rope-cutting knife at hand.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Fenders</strong></p>\n<p>You can’t have too many. Concrete quays and lock sides are unforgiving and abrasive. Sailing boats with their elliptical sides need big fat round ones fore and aft with a row of cylindrical <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/reviews/gear/the-best-fender-cleaner-we-put-the-silky-cream-cleaner-to-the-test\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fenders</a> along the side. The stern is particularly vulnerable when leaving a concrete quay. Fender socks are useless as they hold dirty, wet grit. Rubber tyres are frowned upon because if they break free and sink they may jam lock gates, although they are permitted if made to float and are attached at two points.</p>\n<p><strong>Fender board</strong></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93658\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93658\" class=\"wp-image-93658 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/ed2006-05-16-10-13-43_0017-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"A fender boat for a boat which is essental when French canal boating\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/ed2006-05-16-10-13-43_0017-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/ed2006-05-16-10-13-43_0017-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/ed2006-05-16-10-13-43_0017-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/ed2006-05-16-10-13-43_0017.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93658\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A notch in the fenderboard stops warps from being worn away on rough lock sides. Credit: Julian and Vanessa Dussek</p></div>\n<p>You need a stout plank to hang outside the fenders. In many locks the water rises very high, allowing fenders to float above the lock edge, leading to direct contact between your <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/expert-advice/boat-fibreglass-repair-a-beginners-guide-83953\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">glassfibre</a> and the stone edge. Ouch! A length of scaffold plank solves this. You will need to cut a notch to prevent the ropes from being worn away.</p>\n<p><strong>A long boathook</strong></p>\n<p>By long we mean about six to eight feet. It is not intended for pushing or pulling the boat but as a means of handling warps so it can be quite slender and can be made very cheaply using a 1in (2.5cm) pole from a DIY shop and a boat hook end. It will be needed under two circumstances:<br />\n■ Passing lines up to lock keepers when ascending – they do not like you throwing your lines at them!<br />\n■ Reaching bollards some distance from the boat. Jumping ashore with lines is unnecessary, potentially dangerous and sometimes impossible.<br />\nYou will also need a shorter, stouter boathook for pushing and pulling, and probably a spare for when you drop one overboard and lose it!</p>\n<p><strong>Lifejackets</strong></p>\n<p>In many of the big locks, and in all the Rhone ones, it is mandatory to wear and be seen to <a href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/gear/best-lifejackets-under-300-for-boaters-sailors-73284\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wear a lifejacket</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/yachts-and-gear/what-to-look-for-in-the-best-handheld-vhf-marine-radio-151988\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>VHF Radio</strong></a></p>\n<p>The large locks on the Seine and Rhône require you to contact them by radio, the frequencies are given in the guides or pilot books. Because the lock keepers may be juggling with several ascending and descending barges it is essential to be able to listen for their instructions.</p>\n<p><strong>Steel mooring spikes</strong></p>\n<p>You will need a couple of stout steel spikes (and a hefty hammer) to moor to if stopping at the riverside away from quays and pontoons.</p>\n<p>Even if they are well sunk in they are likely to pull out if a barge passes close by, the suction created is enormous.</p>\n<p>The number of idyllic rural halts was less than we had anticipated because of underwater rocks and debris plus bushes and other obstacles on the bank.</p>\n<h3>Strongly recommended</h3>\n<p><strong>A <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/expert-advice/how-to-make-your-own-sprayhood-or-bimini-as-a-diy-project-63916\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bimini or other form of shelter from the sun</a></strong></p>\n<p>You will not have your mast up and may need to reconsider how you fix your sun shade. Make sure it will not be obstructive in the locks.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Julian and Vanessa Dussek took their Southerly 115 down through France to the Med, about 1,000 miles. Listed here are items they found essential or desirable \nJulian and Vanessa Dussek’s Pluto in typical canal mode with round fenders at each end and cylindrical ones in between. Credit: Julian and Vanessa Dussek\nEssential kit for French canal boating\nExtra-long ropes\nDon’t stint on these. You will need more and longer lines than your normal complement. Warps need to reach up and around lock bollards, which may be set well back from the edge, and then back down to you. Mooring bollards or rings on quays are often designed for barges and may be a long way apart. We bought our ropes from boat jumbles.\nA rope-cutting knife\nWhen going up or down in a lock there is always the potential for a warp to get jammed. The tension on it can become frightening as your boat is either being dragged underwater or suspended from the lockside. It’s essential to have a good rope-cutting knife at hand.\nFenders\nYou can’t have too many. Concrete quays and lock sides are unforgiving and abrasive. Sailing boats with their elliptical sides need big fat round ones fore and aft with a row of cylindrical fenders along the side. The stern is particularly vulnerable when leaving a concrete quay. Fender socks are useless as they hold dirty, wet grit. Rubber tyres are frowned upon because if they break free and sink they may jam lock gates, although they are permitted if made to float and are attached at two points.\nFender board\n\nA notch in the fenderboard stops warps from being worn away on rough lock sides. Credit: Julian and Vanessa Dussek\n\nYou need a stout plank to hang outside the fenders. In many locks the water rises very high, allowing fenders to float above the lock edge, leading to direct contact between your glassfibre and the stone edge. Ouch! A length of scaffold plank solves this. You will need to cut a notch to prevent the ropes from being worn away.\nA long boathook\nBy long we mean about six to eight feet. It is not intended for pushing or pulling the boat but as a means of handling warps so it can be quite slender and can be made very cheaply using a 1in (2.5cm) pole from a DIY shop and a boat hook end. It will be needed under two circumstances:\nLifejackets\nIn many of the big locks, and in all the Rhone ones, it is mandatory to wear and be seen to wear a lifejacket.\nVHF Radio\nThe large locks on the Seine and Rhône require you to contact them by radio, the frequencies are given in the guides or pilot books. Because the lock keepers may be juggling with several ascending and descending barges it is essential to be able to listen for their instructions.\nSteel mooring spikes\nYou will need a couple of stout steel spikes (and a hefty hammer) to moor to if stopping at the riverside away from quays and pontoons.\nEven if they are well sunk in they are likely to pull out if a barge passes close by, the suction created is enormous.\nThe number of idyllic rural halts was less than we had anticipated because of underwater rocks and debris plus bushes and other obstacles on the bank.\nStrongly recommended\nA bimini or other form of shelter from the sun\nYou will not have your mast up and may need to reconsider how you fix your sun shade. Make sure it will not be obstructive in the locks. The sun in the centre of France can be seriously fierce.\nWater strainer, filter and alarm\n\nThe Vetus water filter is easily accessible and above the waterline so it can be opened without turning off the seacock. Credit: Julian and Vanessa Dussek\n\nOne of the main hazards of cruising the inland waterways is an obstruction to the engine water intake, often by weed or polythene bags,\nWe fitted an external strainer and inside the boat a Vetus filter above the waterline so the top could be unscrewed in a hurry without having to close a seacock.\nWe also fitted a Halyard alarm on the water intake pipe.\nThis goes off whenever there is an obstruction on the intake side.\nIt turned out we never had an obstruction in over 1,000 miles of canal motoring.\nMidship cleat\n\nA midships cleat is always useful. Credit: Julian and Vanessa Dussek\n\nInland cruising involves a lot of temporary mooring.\nIt is a major activity and it pays to have a simple and safe system.\nOur technique is to approach our preferred bollard which will be on the side to which the stern will kick when reverse is selected.\nAs the boat comes to a halt we drop a bight from the midships cleat over the bollard, at this point the propeller should be dragging the boat into the quay.\nIf we have misjudged our distance off we motor gently ahead against the warp and as long as it is firmly cleated off the boat will inevitably come to rest against the bank or quay.\nLeaving the engine running gently in gear with the helm appropriately positioned will hold the boat safely as long as you want.\nBooks and maps\nWe found the Guides (charts or maps) invaluable for navigation, showing as they do locks, navigable channels, and canalside facilities.\nAnd Hugh McKnight’s Cruising the French Waterways is a gem we wouldn’t be without.\nMini mast\nWe had our mast removed and sent ahead by road, but even with the mast stowed on deck you may need to make up a small one for the courtesy flag, burgees, and perhaps a spotlight and steaming light.\nYou may also wish to fit a wireless aerial\nBicycles\nBicycles make shopping, eating ashore and exploring much easier.\nWe have folding bikes which can be stored in bags and five years on, they are still in good shape.\nAn alternative is to buy cheap, second-hand bikes that can be abandoned at the end of the trip.\nLittle hooks\n\nPut hooks up wherever you can – they will always be useful. Credit: Julian and Vanessa Dussek\n\nLiving aboard you can. never have too many little hooks, for clothes, keys, binoculars, anything – a very cost-effective improvement.\nA form of heating\nEven in May, we needed our oil-fired heater and hot water bottles in Northern France.\nAn electric fan heated is useful if you have shore power.\nKnowledge of the French language\nEffort in preparing linguistic skills as well as the boat will be rewarded.\nUnderstanding some of the lock keepers on VHF, however, can be testing even for fluent French speakers.\nTime, time, time\nToo many people treat their transit across France as a quick route to the Med.\nYou should allow as much time as you can possibly spare.\nWhen again will you have the chance to traverse the whole of France at walking pace, through major towns, villages, farms, and vineyards?\nAll of French life is there.\nSource of information for French canal boating\nWebsites\nwww.vnf.fr The official site for Voies Navigables de France. Apart from buying your permit here you should check on planned closures of sections of waterways.\nwww.meteo.fr This is the French weather site. Rainfall is your major concern. Heavy rain in the north may, for example, lead to flood conditions later on the Saône and Rhône. Local flooding will close locks.\nwww.theca.org.uk The Cruising Association has an inland waterways section where you can get answers to your questions. They also publish Cruising the Inland Waterways of France and Belgium, now in its 29th edition, which is edited by Gordon Knight.\nwww.masttransporte.de We used Herr Graf to take our mast down to the Med and were very happy with the service.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nInland boating in the UK: a beginner’s guide\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nRupert Holmes and Jonathan Mosse look at boats, seamanship skills, planning and destinations in their guide to inland boating in…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDelphia 11: the roomy cruising boat you can just step on and go\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nJust like today’s sailing cruisers, the new generation of motorboats give you a lot of space for their length.

Once past Hawaii, Craig expects variable winds.\nHe said: “Depending on how slow I’ve been, it could be entering typhoon season. So I just have to make sure that if there’s any type of pressure building, I’m just mega aware about it.”\n\nSafety will be top priority. Father-of-two Craig added: “My family have been out sailing with me so they know my skillset.\nHis previous longest solo voyage was 1,200 miles and 10 days.\nCraig’s biggest fear for the voyage is “any submersible object.”\n\nTriple amputee Craig Wood and family enjoy a liveaboard lifestyle on their 41ft Galileo aluminium catamaran\n\nHow did Craig Wood become a triple amputee?\nAged 18, Craig lost both legs and his left hand during a routine patrol with 2nd Battalion, The Rifles, in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, when an improvised explosive device (IED) blast was triggered.\nIt happened on 30 July, 2009, while Craig was on deployment to his first war zone. His face was also ravaged by shrapnel.\nWaking up 14 days later from an induced coma, nothing would ever be the same again.\nIt took eight months for Craig to learn to walk again and four-and-a-half years of rehabilitation work at the dedicated Headley Court facility in Surrey to improve his quality of life.\n\nCraig Wood before he was injured as a teenage Army rifleman\n\n\nCraig Wood and colleagues before he was injured as a teenage Army rifleman\n\nBack home as a triple-amputee, he returned to the hobby his father had shared with him as a child on their family trips to Bridlington – sailing.\nA Paralympic coach, contacted by his father, arranged a taster session for Craig on a 2.4mR. Craig “immediately loved it and how accessible it was” and a year later got his own boat with assistance from Help for Heroes.\nCraig spent two years racing 2.4mRs before competing in the Sonar keelboat class on the Paralympic circuit with crewmates Steve Palmer and Liam Cattermole.\nDespite extensive training, the trio missed out on 2016 Games selection, then the class was sadly dropped from the 2020 Paralympic sport line-up.\nWhile in Melbourne, at the 2015 Para World Sailing Championships, Craig spent an afternoon sailing on a yacht and “fell in love with the idea of sailing around the world.”\n\nCraig Wood undertaking dusty boat work\n\nBy April 2016, he had bought a Colvic Victor 40, which he spent months refitting before departing from the River Orwell in April 2017, a day after his 26th birthday.\nAfter a year of cruising Never Ending Story to the Mediterranean, Craig wanted a boat better suited to light winds to sail around Cape Horn. In Lefkada, he found the Beneteau Oceanis 46, Sirius.\nHaving made improvements to the boat’s electrics and solar panels, he sailed on, either solo or with crew.\nWhile in Gibraltar in December 2018, he met Renate Gwerder, who was hitchhiking to South America, who would later become his wife.\nToday, Craig is the world’s first triple amputee to achieve Yachtmaster status.\nFavoured kit\n\nCredit: GD Media\n\nAdaptions Craig has made to his multihull include running all the lines aft to the helm station, and an electric winch. Handhelds were already in place.\nCraig will be using the PredictWind weather forecasting app.\nHe praised the Starlink satellite communication system as being “an amazing thing to have, it gives you the ability to call anyone about a subject and they can show you videos as well. It makes safety so much more accessible.”\nMeteorologist for the British Sailing Team, Simon Rowell, author of Weather at Sea, will be Craig’s first call should weather become unpredictable.\nOther recommended gear on board a watermaker “so you can have showers all day”, his B&G NAC-3 autopilot and his B&G V60 Radio with AIS.\nCraig said: “I’ve got a hydraulic steering system and I really like having AIS on board because I can set alarms and when I’m solo it’s having that guard zone is great, it means I can have a deep sleep, without worrying about crashing into a boat.”\n\nRegarding lifejackets, Craig prefers his Crewsaver, as it enables him to “sit down comfortably.”\nVoyage sponsor Henri Lloyd has kitted him out with their Elite Offshore jacket in orange, to increase visibility. He also has a SOLAS-approved clip-on LED flare, a SmartFind personal locator beacon and personal AIS.\nHe said: “One of the things on my mind is not to get too complacent. Although I might just be going to the back of the boat for a second, I still need to be clipped on, and to be taking as much care as possible.”\n\nCraig is hoping to catch fish to eat along the way, and will be taking “a lot of dried food such as rice and noodles. I’ve got a nice big freezer that I’ll fill with 15kg of meat, plus tins of veg.”\n\nHero’s welcome\nSupporters can follow Craig’s progress via a DataHub tracker and the Iridium Go tracking page.\nAmong the family and friends who will be greeting Craig in Japan will be wife Renate, son Amaru aged 3 and daughter Madeira, aged 2.\nCraig said: “I think they’ll be arriving a couple of days before. That will be really nice and emotional.”\nHis scariest sailing moment so far was off the coast of Argentina, aboard his Beneteau, bound for the Falklands, when a powerful gust of wind hit.\nCraig said: “I had 50% of my genoa out. We had that much windage, it turned the boat and I was hard over trying to bear away. The boat would not go.\n\nTriple amputee Craig Wood and family enjoy a liveaboard lifestyle on their 41ft Galileo aluminium catamaran\n\n\nCraig with his wife Renate and two young children\n\n\nHe added: “But that’s pretty lucky in eight years of sailing. We’ve been living the dream.\n“Sailing has helped me to overcome my injuries because it was something I could do before I was injured. It’s taken me from the darkness into the light.\n\nCraig hopes to achieve a £50,000 fundraising target for Blesma and Turn to Starboard, via his givestar charity fundraising page.\nFollow Craig’s updates at @CraigWoodSails on Instagram\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFlorentino Das: a shoestring voyage of adventure across the Pacific in a 24ft boat\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nRichard King and Serafin Colmenares Jr. look back at the remarkable Pacific voyage of Florentino Das in his 24ft home-built…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSailing solo: how to go from crewed to single-handed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nRound the world sailor Ian Herbert-Jones shares valuable advice on how to transition from crewed to single-handed sailing\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nHow to catch fish while sailing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCatching supper with hook and line is a pastime most yachtsmen will attempt at some time or other, but why…\nWant to read more cruising articles?\n\nA subscription to Practical Boat Owner magazine costs around 40% less than the cover price.\nPrint and digital editions are available through Magazines Direct – where you can also find the latest deals.\nPBO is packed with information to help you get the most from boat ownership – whether sail or power.\nTake your DIY skills to the next level with trusted advice on boat maintenance and repairs\nImpartial in-depth gear reviews\nPractical cruising tips for making the most of your time afloat\nFollow us on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter",

Ahmet had expressed a wish to go to the Channel Islands, he wanted to take on the responsibilities of being master in charge of his vessel.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/seamanship/why-you-should-still-make-a-passage-plan-88293\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">passage planning</a> started as soon as we agreed to go. The 10-day forecast looked good, but we studied the Windy and Passage Weather websites every day in the build-up, to check that the various models stayed in agreement.</p>\n<p>Closer to our departure date, the Met Office’s extended outlook for Niton, along with inshore and shipping forecasts, were also monitored.</p>\n<p>We also made sure that the paperwork was ready, including familiarity with the <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/news/changes-to-the-uks-submit-a-pleasure-craft-report-service-announced-85781\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Border Force reporting form</a>. As some of the alternative ports were in France we had to be prepared for that.</p>\n<p>As well as a passport, we needed the small ship&#8217;s registration document, ship&#8217;s radio licence and insurance document.</p>\n<p>One person on board needs to have the International Certificate of Competence and VHF operator’s licence. A red ensign is required to identify the boat as British. And a Q flag should be carried, along with the courtesy ensigns for the ports to be visited. Fortunately, I already had these.</p>\n<p>We also had a sealed envelope on board with our medical details, just in case one of us became ill.</p>\n<h3><strong>Tidal focus</strong></h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_93545\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93545\" class=\"size-large wp-image-93545\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/web_Gilbert_Needles_2-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"The Needles lighthouse, Isle of Wight, pictured from the sea\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/web_Gilbert_Needles_2-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/web_Gilbert_Needles_2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/web_Gilbert_Needles_2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/web_Gilbert_Needles_2.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93545\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Leaving Lymington early in the morning gave us a wonderful view of the Needles</p></div>\n<p>This trip was <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/seamanship/nav-nutshell-curved-track-straight-32181\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mostly about tides</a>.

I found Windy (online or via the app) to be the best guide for this, plus Passage Weather (online only), and the BBC/Met Office forecasts.</li>\n<li>Old hands may be able to <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/seamanship/basic-survival-celestial-navigation-88064\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">navigate by beacons, and even the stars</a>, but I know my limitations and <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/expert-advice/nav-equipment-and-electronics-how-to-set-up-your-boat-on-a-budget-65096\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rely on GPS</a>. But I do ‘gross error’ checks, for instance, ‘is that headland where it should be on the multifunction device (MFD)?’ and always take a back-up in case my MFD fails – I have Navionics on my phone and iPad.</li>\n<li>My Garmin rubber MFD cover contains magnets and needs to be stowed well away from the electronic compass, or it can interfere with the compass reading and <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/expert-advice/electronic-repair-guide-65369\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">play havoc with the GPS system</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/seamanship/sailing-in-fog-tips-to-keep-you-safe-90900\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crossing the shipping channels</a> was straightforward; if in doubt, slow down and go behind any big ship. Of more concern are the narrows on both sides of <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/cruising/trapped-in-thick-fog-with-my-8-year-old-daughter-whilst-on-passage-to-france-67548\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alderney: The Race</a> (between Alderney and France) and The Swinge (between Alderney and Burhou). Both can be tricky so time your passage correctly using Reeds, or The Channel Pilot (an essential guide). If in doubt, you can always opt to go west of Burhou, and avoid both The Swinge and the Race.</li>\n<li>If you’re going to St Peter Port or St Helier you also need to check when the tidal gates are accessible, so you can get in and out.

The coastguard will ask that you notify them when you’ve arrived. So, on arrival ask the local coastguard to notify (eg) Solent Coastguard of your arrival</li>\n<li>We started our return journey from Guernsey at night. I learned the importance of having <a href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/gear/tested-led-searchlights-for-sailors-77657\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a torch with a powerful beam</a> – not just an iPhone torch or a headband torch. That torch, and a back-up, need to be fully charged the day before and then placed where you can easily get them. A good marine torch might cost upwards of £50 but that is probably no more than your diesel cost for 10-20 miles!</li>\n<li>At night you need to be able to dim your MFD. So, check you know how to do that (you can’t rely on the auto-dim feature to darken it enough). If you have other non-dimmable instruments, then a cloth might be useful to cover them if they are too bright. Also, adjust your MFD so en-route navigation lights are not static but flash on screen, as that may help you identify them in the dark.</li>\n<li>When you depart at night, go very slowly through the port and double-check your GPS is 100% accurate and that your autopilot is also 100% accurate. You will be relying on them.</li>\n<li>I often suffer from travel sickness, so I took over-the-counter pills before we left. As the ‘driver’ you’ll be concentrating on the passage and looking at the horizon, both of which reduce the chances of being sick. Dry biscuits, such as digestives, are a useful companion – I avoid chocolate or sweet biscuits. If your passengers get worried about seasickness beforehand, remember that there are lots of ferries to and from the Channel Islands. So, they could meet you there.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/gear/buyers-guide-to-shock-absorbing-boat-seats-90065\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stabilisers are a real help</a>. I’m fortunate to have a boat that has both Humphree interceptors and a Seakeeper gyro system. Both worked excellently. In particular, the Seakeeper makes a significant difference to the sideways movement of the boat (especially at low speeds). It is expensive (mine was £75,000) but it does a fantastic job and is highly recommended – even if you are not prone to seasickness.</li>\n<li>My boat, a Nordstar 42, performed excellently. It is a robust boat, designed for the tough climate of Finland, but it is also comfortable and has a nice, high-quality interior. I can unashamedly say the boat is far better suited to a trip of this sort than me. It has a top speed of about 39 knots, but in a Force 3-4 I didn’t want to go faster than 20-22 knots because it was too bumpy, especially as my passenger doesn’t have a suspension seat.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Gilbert Park helps a fellow motorboater to take his own boat to the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey, and gets a lesson in the perils of bodged electronic navigation settings\n Rock-dodging and the importance of sometimes not trusting the plotter. Painting credit: Claudia Myatt\nAfter a season of cruising his new Nordstar 42 in The Solent with me, my friend Ahmet was keen to advance his seamanship and electronic navigation skills with an extended voyage.\nIn October we both had a weekend free. Ahmet had expressed a wish to go to the Channel Islands, he wanted to take on the responsibilities of being master in charge of his vessel.\nThe passage planning started as soon as we agreed to go. The 10-day forecast looked good, but we studied the Windy and Passage Weather websites every day in the build-up, to check that the various models stayed in agreement.\nCloser to our departure date, the Met Office’s extended outlook for Niton, along with inshore and shipping forecasts, were also monitored.\nWe also made sure that the paperwork was ready, including familiarity with the Border Force reporting form. As some of the alternative ports were in France we had to be prepared for that.\nAs well as a passport, we needed the small ship’s registration document, ship’s radio licence and insurance document.\nOne person on board needs to have the International Certificate of Competence and VHF operator’s licence. A red ensign is required to identify the boat as British. And a Q flag should be carried, along with the courtesy ensigns for the ports to be visited. Fortunately, I already had these.\nWe also had a sealed envelope on board with our medical details, just in case one of us became ill.\nTidal focus\n\nLeaving Lymington early in the morning gave us a wonderful view of the Needles\n\nThis trip was mostly about tides. We identified tidal gates for the Needles, the Alderney Race and the sill for St Helier Marina on the first day.\nAhmet, who is a whizz with an Excel spreadsheet, produced one that allowed us to put in a time for leaving Lymington that then had the periods for the gates and these were coloured green when we were in a safe period.\nWe decided to depart from Lymington, in case the weather changed and made the crossing difficult.\nWe arrived there on Thursday night, from the boat’s base in Northney, Hayling Island (37 miles), in time for dinner at our favourite Indian restaurant Rivazz.\nFriday morning dawned a beautiful day, but the red sky was a little concerning. My anxiety was heightened when I looked at the BBC weather and found a hurricane was forecast!\nAlthough the forecast was later well-publicised as being completely wrong, it might not have been so obvious had it only been out by 20mph.\nThis is a great example of why I use wonderful weather forecasting apps but I still check them with a forecast written by a human.\nBoth the Shipping Forecast and the two inshore forecasts were good and at 0800 we slipped our lines.\nLeaving harbour, we did a wide open throttle test – if something was going to break now was the time. All was OK so it was time to start the RYA SafeTrx app that informed our shore contacts we had begun, where we were going and what time to worry!\nNext, we gave a passage plan to Solent Coastguard, calling them up on Ch16 and asking for a working channel (Ch67).\nShipping lanes and electronic navigation\n\nWe knew we were entering the Alderney Race when we were abeam of the lighthouse at Cap de la Hague and Alderney\n\nOnce past the Isle of Wight, we settled down to enjoy the ride. The sea was calm and coffee was served, along with a biscuit or two.\nCrossing the traffic zones gave us the chance to explore using radar, automatic identification system (AIS) was familiar already.\nThe main advantage on this trip was to use the mini-automatic radar plotting aid (MARPA) which locks onto a target and will show direction as well as the closest point of approach (CPA) and time to closest approach (TCA).\nAlthough these are available from the AIS data some pleasure vessels (as well as warships) may not have this but should show up on radar.\nIn the distance, we saw the Cap de la Hague lighthouse and then Alderney and we knew we were in the Race. We had arrived at exactly the right moment – slack water.\nWe even saw the current arrows on the chart plotter change direction as we entered.\nApart from the odd bump at the start, the Race was remarkably calm.\nThe French coast passed us by quickly, and all the phones and tablets plus the Garmin auto guidance changed to French time causing momentary confusion about our estimated time of arrival.\nAs we got near to Jersey we found out this area is not just about tides but also rocks. They stick up out of the sea like teeth waiting to bite the unwary.\nThe night before we’d studied the route provided by using the autoroute function and I couldn’t understand why it was suggesting we went close to a rocky shore that dries!\nWe avoided it and went outside of it.\nThe next day it had us going in between a big rock and the lighthouse, we ignored that route as well.\n\nElectronic navigation: The auto routing on the Garmin chart plotter wanted to take us through the rocky coast. Once the error in the settings was discovered the reason for this became clear\n\nOn our return, I contacted Garmin and discovered that the auto guidance depth of the boat was set to zero metres! The factory default is 3m and at some time it had been changed to 0m.\nThe autorouting function therefore assumed we needed no water to go over drying areas. Readers might like to check their own settings in any auto guidance system from time to time.\nInterestingly, it also transpired that the rubber cover for the screen has strong magnets in it and when stored near the instrument pod it upset the electronic compass (installed in the pod) giving a false heading.\nWe arrived at St Helier, Jersey, to find it was almost full and we had to moor next to a much bigger motorboat called Starship.\nThere were both 16A and 32A connectors for electricity and knowing this I’d brought my adapter for the larger one.\nThe log for that day showed we had travelled 108 miles and this had taken 5 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nMoored up in St Peter Port, Guernsey. You can’t see them but all the correct flags are flying, courtesy, Q and red ensign\n\nGuernsey bound \nAfter dinner in the nearby former abattoir, we had an early night ready for the next day.\nWhen we awoke it was raining and had been all night. After a relaxed start, it was off to Guernsey. Again a nice, calm day and soon St Peter Port was visible. Diesel is inexpensive here (89p/lt) so we took the opportunity to fill up.\nThe harbour master found us a nice mooring on G pontoon (furthest from the road and the pedestrian crossing).\nA walk around town to the market and tea and cake at Gracies, next to the market, and it was back to the boat. We had travelled 26 miles in 1 hour and 20 minutes.\nMy wife had offered to cook a Sunday roast for us at 7pm, so we had to be back for that.\nLooking at the sill times it would be touch and go since we were now at afternoon tides. So, as we walked back we discussed a night crossing.\nIf we crossed the marina sill at 0530 we’d have enough water and be back in time to fuel the boat, have lunch, wash the boat, go home for a nap and then have dinner, plus Ahmet would get some experience of a night crossing.\n\nRations for the night crossing. Lots of short-term energy-producing foods\n\nOne of the things you do need for a night crossing is snacks. A trip to the Co-op provided biscuits, chocolate and the like. Most of which we didn’t eat.\nThe time before dinner in 17 The Pier was filled by writing a pilotage plan for the various lights and preparing the boat (cleaning the windows and the like). Another light dinner and an early night.\nWe crossed the sill with 2m of water under the keel and off we went. Speed was kept down in the dark period and after seeing the dawn behind Alderney we were able to open the throttles.\nThere were many more big boats, and we did have to avoid one by going astern of her.\nThe sea was moderate halfway across the Channel, however soon the Isle Of Wight was visible and then West Pole marking the start of Chichester Harbour and the last leg.\nSoon we were back in Northney to do our jobs. We’d travelled on that day 107 miles in 6h 30min and in total 278 miles.\nAhmet’s reflections from his first channel crossing\n\nGorey Castle, on the south coast of Jersey, stands overlooking the rocky coast\n\nIt’s all about weather and navigation:\nAs a beginner, I don’t want to be above Force 3 or 4, or wave heights of much more than 1m. I found Windy (online or via the app) to be the best guide for this, plus Passage Weather (online only), and the BBC/Met Office forecasts.\nOld hands may be able to navigate by beacons, and even the stars, but I know my limitations and rely on GPS. But I do ‘gross error’ checks, for instance, ‘is that headland where it should be on the multifunction device (MFD)?’ and always take a back-up in case my MFD fails – I have Navionics on my phone and iPad.\nMy Garmin rubber MFD cover contains magnets and needs to be stowed well away from the electronic compass, or it can interfere with the compass reading and play havoc with the GPS system.\nCrossing the shipping channels was straightforward; if in doubt, slow down and go behind any big ship. Of more concern are the narrows on both sides of Alderney: The Race (between Alderney and France) and The Swinge (between Alderney and Burhou). Both can be tricky so time your passage correctly using Reeds, or The Channel Pilot (an essential guide). If in doubt, you can always opt to go west of Burhou, and avoid both The Swinge and the Race.\nIf you’re going to St Peter Port or St Helier you also need to check when the tidal gates are accessible, so you can get in and out. Add those times to your route planning.\nMy departure checklist\n\nMoored up in Jersey next to Starship. No Captain Kirk was seen\n\n\nBoat checks (engine; all filters including generator; water in the tanks; water in windscreen washers)\nCorrect flags?\nNotify Border Force (24-2 hours before departure)\nSend SafeTrx (app) notification\nNotify the coastguard of the passage plans: when leaving the UK or Channel Islands (not France) call the coastguard on Ch16 to request working channel; then change to that channel. When prompted say: “wish to file a passage plan for … MMSI ….., Call Sign……; A to B, …. persons on board, ETA …., details on SafeTrx”. The coastguard will ask that you notify them when you’ve arrived. So, on arrival ask the local coastguard to notify (eg) Solent Coastguard of your arrival\nWe started our return journey from Guernsey at night. I learned the importance of having a torch with a powerful beam – not just an iPhone torch or a headband torch. That torch, and a back-up, need to be fully charged the day before and then placed where you can easily get them. A good marine torch might cost upwards of £50 but that is probably no more than your diesel cost for 10-20 miles!\nAt night you need to be able to dim your MFD. So, check you know how to do that (you can’t rely on the auto-dim feature to darken it enough). If you have other non-dimmable instruments, then a cloth might be useful to cover them if they are too bright. Also, adjust your MFD so en-route navigation lights are not static but flash on screen, as that may help you identify them in the dark.\nWhen you depart at night, go very slowly through the port and double-check your GPS is 100% accurate and that your autopilot is also 100% accurate. You will be relying on them.\nI often suffer from travel sickness, so I took over-the-counter pills before we left. As the ‘driver’ you’ll be concentrating on the passage and looking at the horizon, both of which reduce the chances of being sick. Dry biscuits, such as digestives, are a useful companion – I avoid chocolate or sweet biscuits. If your passengers get worried about seasickness beforehand, remember that there are lots of ferries to and from the Channel Islands. So, they could meet you there.\nStabilisers are a real help. I’m fortunate to have a boat that has both Humphree interceptors and a Seakeeper gyro system. Both worked excellently. In particular, the Seakeeper makes a significant difference to the sideways movement of the boat (especially at low speeds). It is expensive (mine was £75,000) but it does a fantastic job and is highly recommended – even if you are not prone to seasickness.\nMy boat, a Nordstar 42, performed excellently. It is a robust boat, designed for the tough climate of Finland, but it is also comfortable and has a nice, high-quality interior. I can unashamedly say the boat is far better suited to a trip of this sort than me. It has a top speed of about 39 knots, but in a Force 3-4 I didn’t want to go faster than 20-22 knots because it was too bumpy, especially as my passenger doesn’t have a suspension seat. Even in my suspension seat, I found that speed to be fast enough. Another lesson learned: a suspension seat is worth it.\nExpert response\n\nThe Channel Isles are not just about tides but also rocks. Here they appear like rotting teeth waiting to bite the unwary\n\n\nPaul Bryans, chairman of the Royal Institute of Navigation’s Small Craft Group, responds: Gilbert is to be commended for taking a sensible and cautious approach to this trip and especially the steps he took to check (and avoid) what the electronic navigation system autoroute function was suggesting.\nHowever, his report highlights several issues which are very useful learning points on navigation generally and the use of electronic navigation systems in particular.\nThe first is never to rely on one source of information, however reliable it has proved in the past, or beguiling the system may be.\nNext is to constantly monitor progress, by all available means, once underway and be prepared to change the plan if the situation changes or is different from what you expected (e.g. rougher sea state).\nAutomatic routing functions should always be treated with great care, does the system know about the tidal streams? and does it have a weather feed to predict the sea state?\nWe cannot simply assume the plotter will do all the “navigation” for us, it is merely one navigation aid on board, and the skipper (the master) is always responsible for navigating the vessel from berth to berth.\nModern electronics are great and remove a lot of the drudgery of position fixing and tidal heights etc. but they must be set up carefully with the correct vessel data and time zone etc – always make sure that, in particular when crossing the channel, that your tidal information matches what you might be reading about for crossing a marina cill (French or UK time but also summertime adjustments?).\n\n\nThe exit from St Helier with the depth over the sill being shown on the digital board\n\n\nThere are plenty of pitfalls to avoid, so do you know exactly how your system has been set and did your crew (or the electronic navigation system) change the time zone, to be helpful, when you weren’t looking?\nThe need to update electronic charts should not be overlooked, apps usually have a good value subscription service so update your ‘phone or tablet before you leave home (to use as backups) but when did you last update the charts on your plotter?\nRocks may not move but their charted positions may be corrected, and sand and shingle bars can change quite dramatically from season to season with the buoys marking the channel being relocated as a result.\nDo you have suitable publications on board?\nAn up-to-date paper chart of a suitable scale is always worth having and consulting. It is also an electronics free backup. They are much larger than a plotter screen, so give an excellent overview for passage planning purposes.\nWithout electronic aids would you consider using the route suggested in the example shown?\nThe Imray chart of the area off La Corbière shows hazards and potential overfalls which are either not clear or not shown on the electronic chart image. Reading the RCCPF cruising guide (see note below) would put anyone off attempting the inner route in anything other than a calm conditions and daylight.\nHaving the Channel Pilot available is excellent, but it covers a larger area so may not have as much detail as the more focused local publication.\nUnless you are currently (or very recently have been) studying an RYA shorebased navigation course, you are unlikely to have received any training on how to use electronic navigation systems.\nThe RIN “Electronic Navigation Systems – Guidance for safe use on leisure vessels” is available as a free download from the RIN website; it is currently being updated (and it is surprising how much needs updating after only a few years) but provides clear information on how systems work and should be used.\nElectronic navigation systems used on leisure vessels (the charts and display systems) are not currently approved for navigation by any official body; that does not make them unsafe, but it does mean that they can have limitations and should be used with care – always exercise caution and do a sense check; and, in particular, keep a good lookout.\n\nPaul Bryans is chair of the Small Craft Group of the Royal Institute of Navigation, which is leading the PVNSWG report on electronic navigation systems for the MCA, working closely with the Royal Yachting Association (RYA), Cruising Association (CA) and other experts. He is also chair of the Royal Cruising Club Pilotage Foundation which publishes the “Channel Islands, Cherbourg Peninsula and North Brittany” cruising guide and is an RYA Yachtmaster examiner.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFrom dinghy sailing to the ARC Channel Islands Rally\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFormer dinghy sailors Judy and Jon Hilton bought a yacht last October and will be using the ARC Channel Islands…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSmoothing the cruising – a buyers guide to ‘shock-absorbing’ boat gear and more!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe ability to soften that slamming motion of a fast boat at sea has been greatly helped with more advanced…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBasic survival celestial navigation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMaking a ‘mer pass’ observation is one of the simplest, yet most useful navigation tools for sailors to possess, explains…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBlind navigation: how to find your way in restricted visibility\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIs blind navigation a foggy notion for Yachtmasters, or a useful seamanship skill?

to leave the hull to dry for several months and to employ a surveyor to check the hull’s moisture content before beginning the repair process.</p>\n<p>In this case, the boat had already spent nearly a year in the shed and was virtually ready once we’d removed the gel coat.</p>\n<p>The ambient temperature needs to be above 10ºC for ease of working. As the temperature decreases the resin becomes thicker, is harder to mix, difficult to apply and cures far more slowly.</p>\n<p>In borderline conditions, you can gently warm the resin and hardener using a hot air gun BEFORE mixing.</p>\n<p>Better still, store the resin and hardener in a warm area.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93584\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img

The safest way to do this job is to use an antifouling stripper such as Dilunette gel that removes many layers of antifouling in one go and does not affect the gel coat.</p>\n<p>It’s vital to wear protective clothing, especially chemical-resistant gloves and safety goggles.</p>\n<p>Read the instructions before use.</p>\n<p><strong>STEP 2)</strong> The gel is applied by stippling onto the

piece of sharpened timber makes an ideal scraper and avoids damaging the gel coat. Once the antifouling is softened, it scrapes off easily.</p>\n<p>Once stripped, the hull should be thoroughly washed with clean water.</p>\n<p><strong>STEP 5)</strong> As no more problems were found, it was time to begin <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/expert-advice/how-to-polish-stainless-steel-in-the-workshop-at-home-64115\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">grinding off</a> the gel coat using

Before final sanding, the surface was again washed with fresh water to remove contaminants and prevent them from being ground into the surface.</p>\n<p>For final sanding, use an orbital sander or dual action (DA) type as seen here – DA types are designed to more effectively follow curved contours rather than flatten them.</p>\n<p>It is important to keep the lift and spray rails as sharp as possible

position of the line can now be marked and masking tape applied along the actual line.</p>\n<p>On a hull shape like this with many strakes, the line appears to run in all directions to maintain a straight course but is correct when viewed from the side.</p>\n<p><strong>STEP 4)</strong> At last, it is time to apply the copper resin antifouling.</p>\n<p>It comes in pre-measured packs consisting of resin and hardener in equal proportions, plus a bag of pure copper powder.</p>\n<p>These are mixed in equal amounts following the instructions supplied.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\"

first stage is to apply two coats of epoxy at about two-hour intervals.</p>\n<p>Once the second coat is touch dry, the first coat of <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/gear/best-antifouling-paint-head-to-head-test-71025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">copper</a> resin is applied.</p>\n<p>It needs to be applied thinly and spread well which means working quickly as it soon begins to thicken.</p>\n<p>If it is applied too thickly, the weight of the powder causes the mix to slump into curtains.</p>\n<p>When working beneath the boat, it is even more important to keep the coats thin.</p>\n<p>Don’t worry if <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/expert-advice/how-to-get-a-mirror-finish-on-you-boat-93248\" target=\"_blank\"

final task, which was not an intrinsic part of the job, was to paint the topsides between the waterline and the forward <a

polish the topsides but unfortunately, the previous antifouling at the bow had penetrated the <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/expert-advice/gelcoat-repairs-make-invisible-repair-18060\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gel coat surface</a> making it impossible to polish.</p>\n<p>Although not ideal, it gives the boat some style and the waterline is straight even if it does not correspond with the true line.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-93611\"

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Tony Davies believes the DIY owner can tackle even quite serious damage with just a little care and the right materials\nProtective clothing and a face mask is essential to minimise the affect of dust and toxic chemicals\nThe boat featured here is a 15ft Fletcher speedboat, and it was in desperate need of GRP repair. It was purchased by a couple new to boating who were sadly sold a boat with such hull defects it almost sank on their first voyage. It’s easy to assume that the days of the rip-off merchant are over, unfortunately not.\nI became involved while looking for a suitable boat on which to test a GRP repair and was therefore able to right the wrong perpetrated on these newcomers, thanks to the generosity of Wessex Resins who supplied not only the materials but also an expert who performed much of the work while I stood back and took the photographs!\n\nGRP repair: An upturned, raised hull was easier to work with\n\nThe main problem was there were no clear signs of where the boat was leaking.\nThe floor was bonded-in, making it impossible to examine the hull from the inside.\nBelow the waterline had been ineptly sloshed over with rough antifouling that hid the underlying defects.\nThis meant we didn’t know what we’d find until this layer was removed and we could inspect the gel coat.\nIt was therefore decided, once repairs were made, to sheath the hull with West System materials to cover every eventuality.\n\nGRP repair: A rough patch of mat and resin peeled off easily but the hull seemed solid underneath\n\n\nGRP repair: A flawed strake was a possible point of water entry\n\nScale of GRP repair\nBeing a smallish boat we turned her upside down on blocks of polystyrene which made the job vastly more pleasant.\nFor larger vessels, it is possible to careen them partly onto one side to provide easier access to the bottom.\nI roughly marked the waterline by referring to the limescale stains on the antifouling and lightly scoring the gel coat to give us a line to grind down to.\nThe first problem to appear was a rough patch of mat and resin that had been applied without proper wetting-out or hull abrading and was easily peeled off.\nHowever, there was little sign of real damage beneath this.\nA more serious flaw was found on one of the strakes which had been scuffed deep into the lay up and was still wet.\nThis was a possible water-entry point and duly noted.\n\nThe damaged strake revealed\n\n\nAn old GRP repair was revealed beneath the gel coat but it had not penetrated the hull\n\nDrying time\nFollowing antifouling removal (step by step guide below), the damaged strake was revealed in all its glory and at this stage we left the hull to dry out for a couple of weeks.\nDepending on the size of the vessel and the extent of the repair it may be necessary to leave the hull to dry for several months and to employ a surveyor to check the hull’s moisture content before beginning the repair process.\nIn this case, the boat had already spent nearly a year in the shed and was virtually ready once we’d removed the gel coat.\nThe ambient temperature needs to be above 10ºC for ease of working. As the temperature decreases the resin becomes thicker, is harder to mix, difficult to apply and cures far more slowly.\nIn borderline conditions, you can gently warm the resin and hardener using a hot air gun BEFORE mixing.\nBetter still, store the resin and hardener in a warm area.\n\nThis hole in the side of one of the strakes could have been one of the leak sources\n\n\nVarious voids in the lay-up where the resin had not penetrated during building were scraped out using a special tool that looks remarkably like a big screwdriver!\n\nWatertight hull \nThe process of GRP repair and application of the new antifouling coat (see below) were identical to that needed for osmosis repair.\nWhere there is no need for strengthening the hull additional sheathing with biaxial fabric can be omitted and, instead, six coats of West System epoxy applied.\nWorking on a smooth hull with no strakes or rails is far quicker and simpler than the example shown here.\nPeople occasionally report sensitivity problems with epoxy materials, even when wearing gloves.\nHowever, glove sensitivity is often the underlying problem and changing to a different glove material may be the solution.\nWest System epoxies are ready to overcoat when a finger pressed into the surface marks the surface but comes away dry.\nThe boat was subsequently relaunched and the hull was found to be now totally watertight.\nMaterials used for GRP repair\n\nA West System glassfibre boat repair kit\n\n\nB105 West System resin 5kg and B205 West System hardener 1kg dual packs x 2 (£139.95 x 2) £279.90\n1 x pump set (B pack) 5:1 ratio £20.47 n 2 x 450g/m² biaxial glass fabric 1270mm wide x 10m (£83.28 x 2) £166.56\n1 x 450g/m² biaxial glass tape 125mm wide x 5m £48.85\n2 x Low density filler 0.7kg (£59.80 x 2) £119.60\n1 x 3in roller frame £3.95\n1 x 3in roller covers (pk 12) £11.45\n1 x 7in roller frame £5.74\n1 x 7in roller covers (pk 5) £18.60\n1 x stirrers (pk 5) £10.26\n6 x 800ml mixing pots £8.34\n1 x plastic squeegees (pk 2) £5.46\n4 x roller trays (£3.64 x 4) £14.56\n2 x Nitrile gloves (pk 5) (£9.95 x 2) £19.90\nTotal cost = £733.64 with an estimated 20 work hours plus curing times (a week overall)\nBest online prices correct at the time of going to press\nAntifouling removal – Step by step\n\nSTEP 1) The safest way to do this job is to use an antifouling stripper such as Dilunette gel that removes many layers of antifouling in one go and does not affect the gel coat.\nIt’s vital to wear protective clothing, especially chemical-resistant gloves and safety goggles.\nRead the instructions before use.\nSTEP 2) The gel is applied by stippling onto the surface in a thick layer using a synthetic bristle brush.\nIt can even be spread using a spatula where the antifouling layer is particularly thick.\n\nSTEP 3) The instructions say to leave the gel for between 15 minutes and two hours.\nHowever, it can be left for longer on GRP where the antifouling is thick.\nCover with cling film to stop it drying out.\nThe results can be seen above in the bubbled and crusted antifouling.\n\nSTEP 4) A piece of sharpened timber makes an ideal scraper and avoids damaging the gel coat. Once the antifouling is softened, it scrapes off easily.\nOnce stripped, the hull should be thoroughly washed with clean water.\nSTEP 5) As no more problems were found, it was time to begin grinding off the gel coat using an angle grinder with a coarse sanding disk attached.\nThe amount of dust generated by this process makes it essential to wear full face protection and respirator.\nI use a ‘Racal Dustmaster’ which provides a flow of filtered air over the face.\n\nSTEP 6) Before final sanding, the surface was again washed with fresh water to remove contaminants and prevent them from being ground into the surface.\nFor final sanding, use an orbital sander or dual action (DA) type as seen here – DA types are designed to more effectively follow curved contours rather than flatten them.\nIt is important to keep the lift and spray rails as sharp as possible to maintain the hull’s handling performance.\n\nSTEP 7) With the gel-coat removed, we had a rough line to work to and could also now examine the hull again.\nGRP repair – Step by step\n\nSTEP 1) The repair began with the mixing of the West System Resin using the pump set provided.\nOne stroke of resin to one stroke of hardener is the correct proportion which makes the mixing process simple and accurate.\nIt’s then stirred until thoroughly mixed.\n\nSTEP 2) The mixture is placed in a roller tray and applied evenly over the entire bottom, taking care to work it well into the damaged areas.\n\nSTEP 3) Once the resin has become tacky (after a couple of hours at 15°C) the surface is ready to be faired using the same resin/hardener mix but this time thickened with 407 low-density filler.\nThe resin and hardener are mixed in the normal manner after which handfuls of filler are added to the mix and stirred in until a peanut butter consistency is achieved.\nIt is then applied to the surface with a stirrer in preparation for spreading and fairing.\nUsing a plastic squeegee, the filler mix is worked into the voids and sanding marks until the surface is reasonably smooth.\n\nThe resin and hardener are mixed in the normal manner after which handfuls of filler are added to the mix and stirred in until a peanut butter consistency is achieved\n\n\nIt is then applied to the surface with a stirrer…\n\n\n…in preparation for spreading and fairing\n\nSTEP 4) While filling the surface, the worst of the damaged areas and deepest voids on the strakes were also reinforced with strips of biaxial tape pressed onto the tacky surface.\nResin/hardener mix is then rolled into the fabric until it is thoroughly wetted.\n\nWhile filling the surface, the worst of the damaged areas and deepest voids on the strakes were also reinforced with strips of biaxial tape pressed onto the tacky surface\n\n\nResin/hardener mix is then rolled into the fabric until it is thoroughly wetted\n\nSTEP 5) The rest of the fairing process can now be completed, including filling the drain plug hole in the bottom of the transom.\nAs this boat is to be moored afloat it was decided to discard the drain plug and fit a bilge pump instead.\n\nSTEP 6) The following day the entire bottom was again sanded using only the fine sander to give a fair surface.\nStrakes were carefully profiled by hand to avoid taking off too much material with the sander.\nThe surface was examined and areas requiring additional filling were faired again. The surface was then coated with resin/hardener and allowed to tack off for a couple of hours.\n\n\nStrakes were carefully profiled by hand to avoid taking off too much material with the sander\n\n\nThe surface was examined and areas requiring additional filling were faired again\n\n\nThe surface was then coated with resin/hardener and allowed to tack off for a couple of hours\n\nSTEP 7) The overall sheathing of the hull could now begin.\nThe biaxial cloth used is made up of the same thread as standard woven roving.\nThe difference is, it is woven diagonally to allow it to drape easily over complex contours. The first piece of cloth was laid halfway across the width of the hull at the stern and rolled onto the tacky surface to hold it in position.\nThe awkward shape of the hull and strakes at the transom needed some cutting of the cloth to allow it to lay smoothly.\n\n\n\nSTEP 8) The cloth was then rolled with epoxy until it was thoroughly wetted out.\nThe same procedure was used to sheath the rest of the hull, overlapping each layer as we moved forward.\nThe edge of the mat was trimmed along the waterline using a sharp knife before the mix finally cured.\nSTEP 9) The bottom was filled, faired and sanded down again for the last time ready for application of the antifouling coat which in this case is a copper-infused resin.\nThis should ensure the boat needs no further bottom work for about 10 years other than a light abrading with a Scotch pad.\n\n\nApplying the antifouling coat – Step by step\nSTEP 1) The first stage in applying the antifouling coat was to mark the waterline.\nWe could not be 100% sure where this would come so we made a straight line around the boat hoping it would correspond with the true waterline.\nBlock up a tube or timber across the bow perpendicular to the fore-and-aft line with the top edge level with the position of the waterline at the bow – this enables a string line to be taken from the waterline aft over the top of the timber to give the necessary straight line for marking the line onto the hull.\n\n\nSTEP 2) Unfortunately, you cannot simply draw the string up against the hull as it just rides up or down on the slope.\nThe technique is to draw the string along the timber towards the hull until it comes into contact a couple of inches from the transom.\nTape the string lightly into position at that point.\nThis process is repeated until the string is taped to the hull throughout its length and, although now following the curve of the hull, it is perfectly straight.\nThe beauty of this technique is that the boat does not have to be perfectly level or the right way up, as is the case with the water hose method.\n\n\nSTEP 3) The position of the line can now be marked and masking tape applied along the actual line.\nOn a hull shape like this with many strakes, the line appears to run in all directions to maintain a straight course but is correct when viewed from the side.\nSTEP 4) At last, it is time to apply the copper resin antifouling.\nIt comes in pre-measured packs consisting of resin and hardener in equal proportions, plus a bag of pure copper powder.\nThese are mixed in equal amounts following the instructions supplied.\n\nSTEP 5) The first stage is to apply two coats of epoxy at about two-hour intervals.\nOnce the second coat is touch dry, the first coat of copper resin is applied.\nIt needs to be applied thinly and spread well which means working quickly as it soon begins to thicken.\nIf it is applied too thickly, the weight of the powder causes the mix to slump into curtains.\nWhen working beneath the boat, it is even more important to keep the coats thin.\nDon’t worry if the finish is not perfect as this will not affect the antifouling properties.\nSTEP 6) One of the best parts of the job – pulling the masking tape off and seeing the finished straight line!\n\nSTEP 7) My final task, which was not an intrinsic part of the job, was to paint the topsides between the waterline and the forward spray rail while adding a wide boot-topping.\nThe original plan was to polish the topsides but unfortunately, the previous antifouling at the bow had penetrated the gel coat surface making it impossible to polish.\nAlthough not ideal, it gives the boat some style and the waterline is straight even if it does not correspond with the true line.\n\n \nTony Davies’ only connection with West System and Wessex Resins is as a trade customer, liaising with them on this article.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBoat fibreglass repair: a beginner’s guide\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nNo need to fear GRP repairs with these helpful tips from Andy Pag\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nRemoving antifouling – the job I’ll never do again!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAfter a season on the water and two years in a boatyard, Maximus’s antifouling was old and flaky.

Visit the <a href=\"https://www.selway-fisher.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Selway Fisher website</a> and as well as traditional boat designs you’ll also find some fine art.</p>\n<p>The Medway Doble built by Maurice had a very small V-shaped transom and was about 12ft 6in long.</p>\n<p>It was just about car topable and although I have now given up with this method of transporting a boat it saves the hassle of trailing in exchange for a hernia.</p>\n<p>About the build, Maurice said: “I always found Paul Fisher very helpful on all three boats that I built. There were no pre-cut CNC kits then and I had to loft out the panel shapes from 8&#215;4 ft ply boards all from a series of dimensions in numbers on stations, but it was the traditional way of doing things.</p>\n<p>“The first boat had old-time measurements, eg 2-7-5 meant 2 feet, 7 inches and 5 eighths. For subsequent boats, the dimensions were given in metric.’’</p>\n<p>Regarding the sprit rig, this can be very handy when one wants to put away the sails easily in a crowded river which is why <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/boats/the-beauty-of-the-thames-barge-greta-90204\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thames Barges</a> use them.</p>\n<p>They’re particularly useful in a small boat where the last thing you want is a load of canvas and <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/nautical-almanac/glossary-of-nautical-terms/spar-8510\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spars</a> dumped around your feet while trying to row.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93371\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93371\" class=\"wp-image-93371 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO309.col_clivesboats_medway.Thames_barges_2B80Y5M_alamy-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"Thames barges with red sails sailing up a river\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO309.col_clivesboats_medway.Thames_barges_2B80Y5M_alamy-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO309.col_clivesboats_medway.Thames_barges_2B80Y5M_alamy-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO309.col_clivesboats_medway.Thames_barges_2B80Y5M_alamy-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO309.col_clivesboats_medway.Thames_barges_2B80Y5M_alamy.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93371\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Thames sailing barges use a sprit rig for ease of dropping sails in a crowded river. Credit: R Hughes/Alamy</p></div>\n<p>This is what Maurice has to say about the Doble’s sprit sail: “It’s easy to brail up to take the sprit and the sail up to the mast, with a release shackle at the stern so the mainsheet could be completely clear of the boat aft of the mast. I put in an extra brail lower down, so by pulling that the bunt of the sail was close to the mast and didn’t need lashing. All done from the helm.”</p>\n<p>This rig is also favoured by many of our sailing chums across the Channel with their growing interest in sail and oar dinghies.</p>\n<p>Sprit sails go back a long way in time and can be seen in many old maritime paintings.</p>\n<p>They have a short mast and on a small boat it might be possible to avoid a halyard and just fix/lace the sail directly on to an unstayed mast.</p>\n<p>The set of the sail can be adjusted by means of a snotter at the lower end of the sprit. Lower for a bit more belly and raise for a flatter sail.</p>\n<p>A sprit sail may not be as close-winded as a Bermudan sail but will be very competitive downwind because the rig is lower and the boat will heel less – most boats go faster when sailed upright.</p>\n<p>However, some boat tests have found that the sprit sail outperforms the <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/seamanship/bermudan-rig-vs-junk-rig-17481\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bermudan sail</a> on all points of sailing.</p>\n<p>So, I wouldn’t worry too much about performance comparisons; the sprit rig derived from working boats is all about making life simple and this is why it’s a good choice for a <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/boats/cruising-dinghies-for-timeless-adventures-74307\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cruising dinghy</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93376\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93376\" class=\"wp-image-93376 size-full\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edScreenshot-2025-02-06-at-07.53.53.png\" alt=\"A small boat with a large red sail\" width=\"630\" height=\"597\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edScreenshot-2025-02-06-at-07.53.53.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edScreenshot-2025-02-06-at-07.53.53-211x200.png 211w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edScreenshot-2025-02-06-at-07.53.53-422x400.png 422w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edScreenshot-2025-02-06-at-07.53.53-528x500.png 528w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93376\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Chamberlain Gunning Dory, built in 1983; note the sprit sail rig.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Small boat enthusiast Clive Marsh celebrates the Medway Doble, a derivative of the Peter Boat and other small sprit sail dinghies\nMany double-ended Medway Dobles were homebuilt. Credit: Clive Marsh\nEvery now and then my friend Maurice disappears into his shed or garage and builds a boat. No one knows why he does this when it is much easier just to buy a new or used boat, but I guess he likes to get exactly what he wants and he obviously enjoys the process.\nAfter all, there aren’t many Medway Dobles or sprit sail dinghies on the market.\nHe simply says to those around that he feels a boat coming on and off he goes into his shed again.\nIf he’s not building a new boat, he will find an old one that he can modify.\nHis preference is for working boats with traditional rigs such as the double-ended Medway Doble which is a derivative of the Peter Boat.\nThe Medway Doble was used by the fishermen of Strood, Rochester and Chatham and had a fish well to keep the fish fresh.\n\nThe Medway Doble. The self-tacking jib on the gaff rig means the boat can easily be sailed solo. Credit: Paul Fisher\n\nUsually, Dobles were 18ft to 19ft long with the mast stepped well forward and they carried a sprit sail with a snotter – a device for adjusting the set of the sail. They may also use a small jib.\nThese double-ended dobles were also called doubles because their fish well divided the cockpit into two distinct sections, one for the fish and the other for the crew.\nIt is believed that the name Doble is derived from Double. Sounds feasible to me.\nI like a double-ended boat for the following reasons: they can be useful in a following sea, they look good, are easier to paint and they row well. Not so good is their initial frail stability, and their lack of a transom prevents the easy mounting of an outboard motor.\nHowever, my own double-ended yawl never needed a motor because she rowed brilliantly.\nSelway Fisher Design provides plans for building many traditional boats including a smaller version of the Medway Doble.\n\nClive’s friend, Maurice, launches his home-built Medway Doble. Credit: Clive Marsh\n\nPaul Fisher provided the drawing of his version. Visit the Selway Fisher website and as well as traditional boat designs you’ll also find some fine art.\nThe Medway Doble built by Maurice had a very small V-shaped transom and was about 12ft 6in long.\nIt was just about car topable and although I have now given up with this method of transporting a boat it saves the hassle of trailing in exchange for a hernia.\nAbout the build, Maurice said: “I always found Paul Fisher very helpful on all three boats that I built. There were no pre-cut CNC kits then and I had to loft out the panel shapes from 8×4 ft ply boards all from a series of dimensions in numbers on stations, but it was the traditional way of doing things.\n“The first boat had old-time measurements, eg 2-7-5 meant 2 feet, 7 inches and 5 eighths. For subsequent boats, the dimensions were given in metric.’’\nRegarding the sprit rig, this can be very handy when one wants to put away the sails easily in a crowded river which is why Thames Barges use them.\nThey’re particularly useful in a small boat where the last thing you want is a load of canvas and spars dumped around your feet while trying to row.\n\nThames sailing barges use a sprit rig for ease of dropping sails in a crowded river. Credit: R Hughes/Alamy\n\nThis is what Maurice has to say about the Doble’s sprit sail: “It’s easy to brail up to take the sprit and the sail up to the mast, with a release shackle at the stern so the mainsheet could be completely clear of the boat aft of the mast. I put in an extra brail lower down, so by pulling that the bunt of the sail was close to the mast and didn’t need lashing. All done from the helm.”\nThis rig is also favoured by many of our sailing chums across the Channel with their growing interest in sail and oar dinghies.\nSprit sails go back a long way in time and can be seen in many old maritime paintings.\nThey have a short mast and on a small boat it might be possible to avoid a halyard and just fix/lace the sail directly on to an unstayed mast.\nThe set of the sail can be adjusted by means of a snotter at the lower end of the sprit. Lower for a bit more belly and raise for a flatter sail.\nA sprit sail may not be as close-winded as a Bermudan sail but will be very competitive downwind because the rig is lower and the boat will heel less – most boats go faster when sailed upright.\nHowever, some boat tests have found that the sprit sail outperforms the Bermudan sail on all points of sailing.\nSo, I wouldn’t worry too much about performance comparisons; the sprit rig derived from working boats is all about making life simple and this is why it’s a good choice for a cruising dinghy.\n\nThe Chamberlain Gunning Dory, built in 1983; note the sprit sail rig. Credit: Courtesy of Christopher Cunningham, Small Boats\n\nExperimenting with rigs and sail plans is part of the fun of boat ownership and you can find the rig that suits the intended use of your boat.\nAnother fine small double-ended boat with a sprit sail is the Chamberlain Gunning Dory that Christopher Cunningham built for his father in 1983.\nThe plans are in John Gardner’s Building Classic Small Craft. Christopher Cunningham has kindly supplied the photo (above) which clearly demonstrates the simplicity and usefulness of a sprit rig in a small boat.\nIf you don’t have the time to make a traditional boat you can buy the hull of a working boat (something like a Sussex Beach Boat) and rig her with a short mast, a square sail, sprit boom and snotter and see how she sails.\nTo avoid undertaking serious surgery to the hull you could just fit leeboards although one traditional working boat I rigged sailed well enough with no boards and gave little leeway as long as she was sailed upright.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOrkney Longliner & Sussex beach boat\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nClive Marsh sails from Rye Bay upriver to Bodiam Castle in East Sussex by Orkney Longliner and Sussex beach boat\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nNormandy Flobart & Sussex beach boats\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nProlific boat owner Clive Marsh sings the praises of Sussex beach boats and their French sisters, the Normandy Flobarts\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nHastings Boats: stable and seaworthy dinghies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe smaller Hastings luggers (22ft or less) are called punts – and Clive Marsh has converted several 16ft versions back…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nLune Pilot 11: why you should sail this fine, little boat\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA very interesting boat with a long keel, which makes it slightly unusual for a dinghy\nWant to read more boat articles?\n\nA subscription to Practical Boat Owner magazine costs around 40% less than the cover price.\nPrint and digital editions are available through Magazines Direct – where you can also find the latest deals.\nPBO is packed with information to help you get the most from boat ownership – whether sail or power.\nTake your DIY skills to the next level with trusted advice on boat maintenance and repairs\nImpartial in-depth gear reviews\nPractical cruising tips for making the most of your time afloat\nFollow us on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter",

During 2025 we will establish links with other primary schools in Southport, so that step by step the programme will be expanded. There are 18,000 schoolchildren between the ages of 8 and 18 in our community and we want every child to have the opportunity to have a go at the sport we love, taking advantage of the huge benefits of sailing in terms of mental, social and physical wellbeing and personal development.”</p>\n<h3>In with a chance</h3>\n<p>This year, Sunsail’s Funding the Future initiative will be launched at the <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/event/full-talks-line-up-for-rya-dinghy-show-93346\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RYA Dinghy &amp; Watersports Show</a> on the Sunsail Main Stage between 1pm-1.30pm on 23 February 2025.</p>\n<p>Like last year, clubs will need to submit a 500-word application (see tips below) to be in with a chance to win £6,000. There will also be two runners-up prizes of £2,000.</p>\n<p>The winners will be chosen by a panel of judges which includes Sunsail ambassador Dee Caffari, <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/author/katystickland\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>PBO</em> editor Katy Stickland</a>, the Sunsail team, editor of <em>Yachts &amp; Yachting</em> Online Mark Jardine and the RYA’s director of sport development Rob Clark.</p>\n<p>Dee Caffari urged all RYA-affiliated clubs to apply for a chance to win a Funding the Future prize.</p>\n<p>“Our sport thrives thanks to the dedication of enthusiastic volunteers who selflessly give their time to grow grassroots sailing communities and nurture new talent. It is the passion and commitment of these individuals that will create and inspire the champions of the future,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Supporting these efforts is vital. Increasing participation in sailing ensures the sport remains accessible and inclusive for everyone. Funding the Future provides clubs with the opportunity to showcase their incredible work and be recognised for their achievements. We know that financial support has a significant impact on the clubs that are awarded through this initiative. I am proud to be part of this process– celebrating the efforts of these clubs and helping to secure the future of our sport.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-93814 size-full\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO312.Feature_Funding_Future.sunsail_pressrestricted.jpg\" alt=\"Sunsail logo\" width=\"630\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO312.Feature_Funding_Future.sunsail_pressrestricted.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO312.Feature_Funding_Future.sunsail_pressrestricted-300x133.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">To learn more about Funding the Future or to apply for a chance to win up to £6,000, visit: <a href=\"https://www.sunsail.com/uk/funding-the-future\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>www.sunsail.com/uk/funding-the-future</b></a> or visit Sunsail at the RYA Dinghy &amp; Watersports Show, Farnborough International, 22-23 February 2025.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>10 top tips for a winning Funding the Future application</h3>\n<p><strong>The RYA’s director of sport development, Rob Clark, has this advice to help your entry:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Understand the purpose</strong> Clearly show how the funding will benefit your club.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Now’s your chance! Find out how your sailing club could win up to £6,000 to fund new programmes or equipment\nAfter taking the top prize of £6,000 last year, West Lancashire Yacht Club has set up several programmes allowing local children to try sailing for the first time. Credit: Noreen Fessey\nGrassroots sailing is the lifeblood of our sport. Without the countless hours and dedication of sailing club officers and volunteers, many people – especially children – would not get a chance to try sailing and fall in love with the sport.\nBut for many clubs, financial pressures, especially due to rising energy costs, means innovative ideas to attract new people to sailing are often difficult to achieve.\nThe cost of living crisis also means that potential new sailing members could also struggle to pay even modest fees.\nBringing sailing to the young\nWest Lancashire Yacht Club decided to tackle the problem head-on by running an outreach grassroots sailing programme for the Year 5 pupils at Norwood School in Southport.\nThe club, which has 330 members, is based on the edge of Southport Marine Lake and, over three days, club volunteers took 90 children out sailing for the first time.\n\nThe prize money is being spent on expanding sailing programmes, training and gear at West Lancashire Yacht Club\n\nThe honorary secretary and training principal at West Lancashire Yacht Club, Ian Hughes, said following the success of that initial programme, the club realised it could go further.\n“Southport’s scenic Marine Lake is at the heart of our town, but the majority of local children have never had the opportunity to sail there. The socio-demographic is a mix of affluence and deprivation, with many families struggling to access extracurricular activities for their children,” he said.\n“We ran three school trips for 90 Year Five children. Taking to the water for the first time, they absolutely loved it, it was “the best school trip ever”! Every one of the 90 children was able to experience the joy of sailing, with no barriers of financial circumstance. The feedback from children and staff was overwhelmingly positive.”\n\nWest Lancashire Yacht Club has also run open days for the local community. Credit: Kit Robinson\n\nDue to the huge success, the club decided to establish an after-school programme targeting eight primary schools, all within walking distance of Marine Lake, and hold open days for local families.\nIt also wanted to run further school trips and train seven primary school teachers from Norwood School to learn to sail and develop their skills “to become sufficiently proficient to assist our own volunteers in taking young people out on the water.”\nMore buoyancy aids in different sizes were also needed.\nMaking dreams a reality\nThis is where Sunsail’s Funding the Future came into play.\nThe initiative is open to all RYA-affiliated sailing and yacht clubs in the UK and provides prize money to invest in equipment, develop innovative programmes, and cultivate the next generation of sailors.\nThe winning club receives £6,000, with £2,000 prizes for two runners-up.\n\nWest Lancashire Yacht Club sails out of Southport’s Marine Lake. Credit: West Lancashire Yacht Club\n\nWest Lancashire Yacht Club was one of over 61 clubs last year to submit a 500-word application which outlined how it would use the funding to benefit the local sailing community and their members and attract new sailors.\nIt impressed all the judges and was the clear winner of Sunsail Funding the Future 2024.\n“Winning the Sunsail prize has empowered our volunteers as well as the kids,” explained West Lancashire Yacht Club’s Ian Hughes.\n\nWest Lancashire Yacht Club is aiming to offer sailing to pupils at eight local primary schools. Credit: Noreen Fessey\n\n“It’s given us the confidence to expand the programme, enabling us to buy new safety equipment and fund instruction. During 2025 we will establish links with other primary schools in Southport, so that step by step the programme will be expanded. There are 18,000 schoolchildren between the ages of 8 and 18 in our community and we want every child to have the opportunity to have a go at the sport we love, taking advantage of the huge benefits of sailing in terms of mental, social and physical wellbeing and personal development.”\nIn with a chance\nThis year, Sunsail’s Funding the Future initiative will be launched at the RYA Dinghy & Watersports Show on the Sunsail Main Stage between 1pm-1.30pm on 23 February 2025.\nLike last year, clubs will need to submit a 500-word application (see tips below) to be in with a chance to win £6,000. There will also be two runners-up prizes of £2,000.\nThe winners will be chosen by a panel of judges which includes Sunsail ambassador Dee Caffari, PBO editor Katy Stickland, the Sunsail team, editor of Yachts & Yachting Online Mark Jardine and the RYA’s director of sport development Rob Clark.\nDee Caffari urged all RYA-affiliated clubs to apply for a chance to win a Funding the Future prize.\n“Our sport thrives thanks to the dedication of enthusiastic volunteers who selflessly give their time to grow grassroots sailing communities and nurture new talent. It is the passion and commitment of these individuals that will create and inspire the champions of the future,” she said.\n“Supporting these efforts is vital. Increasing participation in sailing ensures the sport remains accessible and inclusive for everyone. Funding the Future provides clubs with the opportunity to showcase their incredible work and be recognised for their achievements. We know that financial support has a significant impact on the clubs that are awarded through this initiative. I am proud to be part of this process– celebrating the efforts of these clubs and helping to secure the future of our sport.”\n\nTo learn more about Funding the Future or to apply for a chance to win up to £6,000, visit: www.sunsail.com/uk/funding-the-future or visit Sunsail at the RYA Dinghy & Watersports Show, Farnborough International, 22-23 February 2025.\n10 top tips for a winning Funding the Future application\nThe RYA’s director of sport development, Rob Clark, has this advice to help your entry:\nUnderstand the purpose Clearly show how the funding will benefit your club. Whether it’s improving facilities, buying new equipment, expanding youth programmes, or boosting membership, demonstrate a clear and specific plan.\n Be concise and specific Stick to the word limit and focus on key points. Provide specific details about your proposed project or initiative, including timelines, budget breakdowns, and expected outcomes.\n Show the impact Describe the positive impact your club’s project will have on the sailing community. Emphasise how the funding will enhance the overall experience for members and attract new participants.\nDemonstrate innovation Demonstrate creativity and forward-thinking in your proposal. Stand out by showcasing innovative ideas.\nUse clear language Ensure your application is easy to understand and free of jargon. Use plain language to communicate your ideas effectively.\nHighlight sustainability Explain how your project will have a positive effect on the environment. Describe initiatives such as reducing carbon footprints, using eco-friendly materials, or promoting sustainable practices.\nBe passionate Infuse your application with enthusiasm and passion for sailing. Clearly convey why your club deserves this funding and how it will contribute to the growth of the sport.\nProofread and edit Carefully proofread your application for grammar, spelling, and formatting errors. Ask someone else to review it for clarity and coherence.\nSubmit on time Don’t wait until the last minute! Give yourself ample time to complete the application and ensure it’s submitted before the deadline.\nAgree for your application to be considered for other opportunities Even if you are not successful in this application there may be others.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n“Best school trip ever’ leads Lancashire club to win Sunsail’s Funding the Future initiative\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nJudges unanimously voted for West Lancashire Yacht Club (WLYC) in Southport to be the overall winner of Sunsail's £6,000 Funding…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSunsail’s Funding the Future initiative returns to support sailing clubs in the UK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSailing and yacht clubs across the UK can enter Sunsail's Funding the Future compettion to win up to £6,000.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "With the eye-watering cost of teak, Andy Pag decides to lay bargain EVA foam decking in the cockpit of his catamaran\nThe new foam floor replaced the old cork cockpit floor which was hard to keep clean. Credit: All photos Andy Pag\nSince we bought our boat three years ago the cockpit floor has looked pretty shabby.\nThe caulking is peeling, and some of the planks are chipped and ripped. It’s cork, which for my money is the best material for outdoor flooring.\nIt’s a pleasure to walk on barefoot because it’s spongy and doesn’t get roasting hot in the Caribbean sun, it’s hard-wearing and grippy even when wet. It won’t last as long as teak but it’s obviously much cheaper.\nThe big downside with cork is that it holds the dirt. No matter how often I scrub and hose it down, grimy water still flows off it.\nIt’s so grubby that there’s no three-second rule if you drop a biscuit in our cockpit.\nWhile in Guatemala I got quotes for a teak replacement. I thought the labour and wood there would make it an affordable option for the three square metres of flooring I needed, but the quote came back at over £3,000!\n\nThe old cork decking, which was impossible to keep clean\n\nAnd the ‘teak’ they use is actually a similar-looking wood which is never dried for long enough and it’s full of knots and prone to warping.\nI’d have happily gone for cork again but I struggled to find any in strip planking – maybe I should have looked into it while we were in Portugal where there’s a big industry of cork production.\nWith limited options, I just put up with the fraying grimy floor, until I was on board a friend’s boat and noticed his closed cell foam flooring.\nI questioned how rugged it was and he said he’d been impressed with how well it stood up. After a year it still looked like new.\nA few online YouTube bloggers confirmed it was longer lasting than it looked.\nFinding an EVA foam decking supplier\nMy first search got me to SeaDek, a company that specialises in making tailor-cut marine flooring from foam.\nTheir ordering process is a little long-winded. First, patterning material is sent to you; you draw out the shape you need and send it back and finally, the foam flooring is sent. It’s backed with an adhesive so installation looks pretty easy.\nIf the firm has your boat model on file then you’ll be able to skip the patterning step.\n\nFitting EVA foam decking: Andy tried to make sure the butt joins were mostly hidden from view\n\nSeaDek also has a range of colours and designs, from neon disco boat to 1930s classic teak, and if you wanted you could even have your boat name written into the flooring.\nBut the back and forth of deliveries put me off, and it still wasn’t cheap, coming in at over £1,000.\nI couldn’t get the whole cockpit area done in one sheet and ordering two smaller sheets seemed problematic.\nBy then I’d stumbled across the generic sheets available on Amazon.\nThese are flat sheets available in different sizes which you cut yourself. They’re much cheaper and I preferred the idea of being able to tailor the sheets myself rather than hoping the back and forth of patterns would work out.\nThe downside is that they don’t have an elegant border to them, although I guess you could cut out sections to make your own border if you wished.\nRemoving the cork\nI ordered two sheets for just over £100 and set to work pulling up the old cork.\nIt was glued, not screwed, so the best way to separate it from the textured non-slip gel coat underneath was with a reciprocating tool.\nI experimented with a serrated blade but settled on a smooth blade to protect the gel coat. Using a file, I occasionally sharpened the blade as I worked. It’s hard work on the tool and I took frequent breaks to make sure it wasn’t overheating.\n\nThe reciprocating tool worked best with the tail up and digging down slightly into the cork\n\nMost reciprocating tools are designed so their tail is in line with the blade.\nResting it flat on the floor presents the cutting edge at a straight angle. But I found that vibrations coming through the tail while in contact with the floor fatigued the internal battery contacts and I had to stop midway to re-solder them.\nHolding the tail up and digging down slightly also removed the cork more cleanly.\nI used ear defenders and padded gloves to counter the hand numbness the tool’s vibration can cause.\n\nTo ensure the new foam flooring would stick, Andy moped the cockpit area twice, using plenty of detergent before hosing down the soap residue\n\nIt took me a whole day, and I was still left with lots of adhesive residue, but this was stuck firm to the gel coat and its smooth, flat, rubbery finish would make for a better substrate for the foam’s adhesive backing than the dimpled flooring.\nNext, I swept and mopped the floor to remove all the dust I had just created.\nIt’s recommended to use an acetone wipe down on the gel coat to remove greasy residue but I was worried this would leave the remaining adhesive a gooey mess; instead, I did a second mop down with an extra dose of detergent, followed by a hose down to remove the soap residue.\nHow to cut EVA foam decking\nTo cut out the right shapes I used several techniques, from measuring the existing radii of the cork corners to removing the corner pieces intact and using them as a pattern to cut around.\nMeasure twice and cut once was the mantra.\nThe backing is hard to mark even with a Sharpie pen so I switched to making the cuts with the sheet in place.\nSandbags would have helped to keep it in place while I was working. I didn’t have any so I sat or knelt on it to stop it from moving around.\n\nMarking the back of the EVA foam decking didn’t really work, so Andy cut with the sheets in place\n\nThe hardest parts to cut around were the table legs and the water drains, but I took it cautiously and cut in slow increments, sometimes resulting in a rough edge that needed smoothing out with a final trim.\nThe material cuts very easily with a fresh blade.\nI planned the layout so the joins were in less visible places.\n\nAndy dry-fitted the pieces of EVA foam decking before pulling off the backing and sticking it in place\n\nSide by side the join is imperceptible, but joined ends show a noticeable line. Perhaps if I’d cut the foam with the blade at an angle it might have butted together better.\nWith hindsight, I should have bought a third sheet instead of joining the offcuts from my two primary sheets to cover the final third of the floor.\nInstead, I positioned the join to be out of sight under the cockpit table.\nI also noticed that the sides of the sheet were not perfectly square from the factory, and I had to trim one edge on each sheet to make the join to the adjacent sheet look right.\nWill it last?\nThe end result looks amazing. It’s transformed the external appearance of the boat. It almost feels too glitzy compared to what we had before.\nLike freshly whitened teeth, it will take a while to get used to it. I’m very happy with it but I’m still curious to know how it will hold up and how best to maintain it.\nI have three main worries, which time will either confirm as a problem or alleviate.\n\nFitting EVA foam decking: Be slow and steady when cutting around things like table legs and the water drains\n\nIf water gets in underneath it risks weakening the glue.\nAround the edges, that’s easy to deal with using a contact adhesive, but I’ve heard it can create boils that are hard to get behind.\nI hope that the flush residue of adhesive will act as a clean barrier to water penetration.\nI occasionally catch a fish (not often, admittedly) but I hear that this flooring stains if you get fish blood on it.\nWe also eat in the cockpit most days so it’s just a matter of time before it gets oily food stains on it, and I’m not sure what the best product for cleaning it will be.\nI worry that anything with bleach will degrade the foam over time.\nAnd finally, the legs of the fold-out table and the scuba tanks provide points where there’s regular pressure on the foam and I worry that this will lead to permanent indentations over time.\nMultitool tips for laying EVA foam decking\n\nAndy found that rather than a serrated blade, a smooth blade on the reciprocating tool was best for cutting away the old cork\n\n\nUse the reciprocating tool’s tail to set the angle of the blade.\nIt is the movement of the blade that does the cutting and applying too much pressure will trap the blade and slow your progress. Less is more.\nRest it if it’s getting hot and don’t knock it about while it’s at temperature. Motor wires are more fragile when they’re hot.\nHow to remove and replace the cockpit sole: step-by-step\n\n1. Measure up based on where the existing flooring lies.\n\n2. Confirm your radius measurements are correct by checking with a pair of compasses.\n\n3. Plan your layout to avoid having to butt the ends of sheets together – if that can’t be avoided, plan to have them hidden away from view.\n\n4. Rip up the old flooring to leave a smooth, flat substrate.\n\n5. Brush, mop and hose it down. Acetone wipe if appropriate.\n\n6. Check the edges of your sheeting are square, and trim if necessary.\n\n7. Cut out and dry fit your first sheet.\n\n8. Holding the sheet in place with sandbags or body weight, cut out positive shapes like table legs and drainage holes.\n\n9. Remove a corner of the backing and stick the flooring down, removing the rest of the backing from underneath a little at a time as you press the foam into position. Make sure you keep it aligned and flush to avoid kinks.\n\n10. Line up and fit the adjacent sheets. Trim the shared edges to disguise any mismatch in length.\n\n11. The cork cockpit sole before the replacement work was started.\n\n12.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Swiss racer Renaud Stitelmann has taken the crown in the 2024 Globe 5.80 Transat, crossing the Atlantic in just over 22 days in his 19ft plywood yacht\nRenaud Stitelmann crossed the line in Antigua, after sailing 2,877nm. Credit: Christine Turner/CG580T/ MGR2025\nThe 2024 Globe 5.80 Transat is a race like no other, where skippers race their homebuilt 19ft boats across the Atlantic.\nThis year, 12 sailors took on the challenge from Lanzarote in the Canary Islands to Antigua.\nSolid trade winds meant the fleet had good daily average speeds, with the winner, Renaud Stitelmann, crossing in 22 days and 5 hours, making average speeds of 5.62knots/135 miles a day.\nThis was despite discovering a cracked spreader mid-Atlantic.\nHe is the second Swiss sailor to have won a Globe 5.80 Transat – with Etienne Messikommer winning the inaugural race in 2021 aboard Numbatou; the boat also took part in the 2024 Globe 5.80 Transat skippered by British sailor, Jasmine Harrison.\n\nNiels Kamphuis experienced strong tradewinds; he was also knocked down, losing a spinnaker pole overboard. Credit: World’s Toughest Row/MGR2025\n\nFellow Brit Keri Harris took second place, arriving just over 4 hours behind Stitelmann, while Niels Kamphuis took third aboard Biggest Monkey.\nKeri Harris has raced extensively offshore in the Pacific, Mediterranean and South China Seas, and was neck and neck with Stitelmann at the race start. The pair battled it out across the Atlantic, with Kamphuis and fourth-placed Dan Turk chomping at their heels.\nThe whole fleet experienced highs and lows in the weather, with some becalmed for days while others dodged 50-knot squalls mid-Atlantic. Kamphuis broke a spinnaker pole after being knocked down, but other skippers faired worse.\nBritish sailor Adam Waugh suffered two cracked ribs after falling onto his deck, but managed to continue following remote medical advice.\nHis Little Wren is the first boat he has ever built and he expressed his sense of achievement at having sailed the yacht successfully across the Atlantic (although he did lose his spinnaker pole along the way).\n\nAdam Waugh, a Yachtmaster Offshore and RYA Cruising Instructor, built Little Wren himself before extensive sea trials ahead of the race.

Ross.</em></p>\n<p>Their legacy could be said to be without a chance: they became the first African Americans to have <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/seamanship/sailing-solo-how-to-go-from-crewed-to-single-handed-93408\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sailed around the world single-handed.</a></p>\n<p>Why emphasise African American in place of just sailor? Good question that I hope to answer in this article.</p>\n<p>“I started sailing in Puerto Rico and I loved it from the start,” Captain Bill Pinkney nods and continues, “I think it’s the independence of it. In sailing, you have absolute sovereignty. You have an opportunity to at least temporarily capture nature and bend it to your will. I say temporarily because nature changes. The sea’s calm and then it’s stormy. When you think you’ve mastered it, it masters you.”</p>\n<p>If you met the very affable Bill Pinkney on the street or while trying to talk you into supporting one of his projects, you’d not think of him as a humble man.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93489\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93489\" class=\"wp-image-93489 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.bill_01_press-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"Capt Bill Pinkney talking to children about his voyage around the world\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.bill_01_press-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.bill_01_press-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.bill_01_press-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.bill_01_press.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93489\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bill Pinkney has used his sailing experiences to inspire young people.

No, the one-time limbo exhibitionist and Revlon executive would not be the one facing the wall at a party.</p>\n<p>But Pinkney was also dedicated to paving the way for children to be confident and not shy to get aboard sailing boats the way he was when he was young.</p>\n<p>Of course, <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/practical-projects/how-we-designed-and-built-a-folding-dinghy-for-under-350-64817\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">building a dinghy</a> and having to be rescued might have influenced the safety part of his push to get children into a real grasp of freedom offered by sailing, and away from the grasp of the street.</p>\n<p>For his circumnavigation, Pinkney chose a cutter-rigged Valiant 47, named appropriately <em>Lone Star</em>.</p>\n<p>Why did he choose this particular design and sail plan?

Credit: Bill Pinkney/Chicago Maritime Museum</p></div>\n<p>With the vision of owning this boat the direction of his project changed.</p>\n<p>“I was going to sail around with a 32ft boat, go through the Panama and Suez Canals and write to my grandchildren to tell them not only about where I was and what I was doing, but how I was using all of the things that I learned in the first 12 years of education.”</p>\n<p>But using his mantra, ‘Never let a chance go by.’ he changed the concept, bought <em>Lone Star</em>, renamed her <em>Commitment</em>, changed rigging and equipment where needed and sailed 27,000 in a little less than a year and a half alone.</p>\n<p>He was 55, with very little experience of sailing long distances alone, having mostly raced as crew or solo aboard his 28ft Pearson Triton in Lake Michigan.</p>\n<p>His scheduled stops were at Salvador, Brazil, Cape Town in South Africa (where he memorably sailed past Nelson Mandela’s island prison of Robben Island, flying a spinnaker of red, black and green (the colours African Americans displayed in their struggle for freedom from second-class citizenship and discrimination), Hobart, Tasmania, and Punta del Este in Uruguay.</p>\n<p>With further acumen, Pinkney moved the original concept to a greater one by giving sponsorship talks with the idea of then transmitting a daily passage report to 30,000 children.</p>\n<p>At each stop, he’d send videotaped messages home to his wife, Ina, and the school children of Chicago and Boston; 700 students were on the dock at the Charlestown Navy Yard to greet him as he tied up <em>Commitment</em> behind the USS Constitution on his return.</p>\n<p>“The streets do offer a need for self-reliance and observance of ever-changing situations. I found that the youth who were court referrals grasped the concept of change faster than those I taught who did not have that need in everyday life.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93487\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93487\" class=\"wp-image-93487 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.bill_02_alamy_2P78AFJ-630x355.jpg\" alt=\"Capt Bill Pinkney at the wheel of a ship\" width=\"630\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.bill_02_alamy_2P78AFJ-630x355.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.bill_02_alamy_2P78AFJ-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.bill_02_alamy_2P78AFJ-768x433.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.bill_02_alamy_2P78AFJ.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93487\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Capt Bill Pinkney was the captain of the replica of <em>La Amistad</em> for two years, sailing the ship to Europe, Africa and the Caribbean. Credit: Associated Press/Alamy</p></div>\n<p>Bill Pinkney was a man who came from the streets, with the single parent and poverty background that many see as destined to end only one way, but he went another way that showed alternatives that he was open to throughout his life.</p>\n<p>‘Never let a chance go by’ helped him sail around the five southernmost capes to tie up where he’d cast off.</p>\n<p>Then he went on to get sponsorships for his Middle Passage Project voyages to Africa, South America and the US to form an African studies curriculum for teachers who made the voyages.</p>\n<p>His crowning achievement was to be the first skipper aboard the era-replicated <em>Amistad</em> and to meld that representation of a successful slave mutiny into a Middle Passage Project voyage under the auspices of the Mystic Seaport Museum. (The original ship, La Amistad, was seized by the authorities after Mende captives took control of the ship in Cuba and tried to sail it back to Africa. The subsequent court case became the first human rights case in the US Supreme Court, which was won by the Mende.)</p>\n<p>Captain Pinkney emphasised the freedom aspect of the sailing world, “… that’s the identity that all of us who sail want. Religion, sexuality, colour, none of that has anything to do with the fact that, first and foremost, we’re sailors.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, written maritime history usually emphasises European maritime history.</p>\n<p>We, up to this moment, still have to say Black maritime history to include what is being scantily researched about our involvement on the water.</p>\n<p>Going back through time, Black mariner, Captain Alexander Leidesdorf sailed his schooner (with a crew) from New York to the village of Yerba Buena and after setting up trade routes between Mexico, Hawaii, Alaska and this little village he had the name officially changed back to the Spanish Mission name of San Francisco de Assisi.</p>\n<p>Captain Leidesdorf is buried at Mission Dolores. Assisting the first successful slave revolt in Haiti was the first Black officer in the British Royal Navy, Captain John ‘Jack Punch’ Perkins who captured over 300 ships during his service.</p>\n<p>The first back-to-Africa movement was accomplished by the Horatio Alger-type Captain Paul Cuffe who took them to Sierra Leone aboard one of his 11 ships.</p>\n<p>Cuffe traded and whaled along the coast of Africa, the Mediterranean, the Baltic and even the slave-owning states in the newly founded United States of America.</p>\n<p>The first six books written about the enslavement experience in America were written by Black mariners who understood and appreciated the concept of freedom.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93483\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93483\" class=\"wp-image-93483 size-full\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.ted_seymour_04_reader.jpg\" alt=\"Teddy Seymour the sailor wearing sunglasses and smiling\" width=\"630\" height=\"891\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.ted_seymour_04_reader.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.ted_seymour_04_reader-141x200.jpg 141w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.ted_seymour_04_reader-283x400.jpg 283w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.ted_seymour_04_reader-354x500.jpg 354w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93483\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Teddy Seymour spent less than $6,000 during his 16-month voyage, and supplemented his stores of rice and beans with fish.

During those seven years, he accumulated most of the funds through saving and keeping his life simple.</p>\n<p>“A major decision was made during the summer of 1985, to become departure-date oriented. After the February 1986 departure date was set, the level of motivation reached zenith, and preparation activity heightened during several busy months.” Captain Seymour’s boat was generally sound as proven by his voyage from San Diego to the US Virgins.</p>\n<p>“My Ericson 35 is a solid, full <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/boats/keel-types-and-how-they-affect-performance-76621\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keel</a> boat. During 11 years of ownership, she has been heavily reinforced, modified, and equipped for <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/seamanship/a-solo-sailor-shares-his-top-safety-tips-92707\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">solo cruising</a>. The running rig was altered for the purpose of safety and convenience. Sails are hoisted by halyards tended from the cockpit. Lowering sails is also accomplished from the cockpit by pulling lines led to the head of the sails.</p>\n<p>“The mainsail is held on the boom by lazy jacks, and the jib is held on the deck by a net connected to the forward stanchions. This method reduces the possibility of being thrown overboard in a rough sea, and the displeasure of getting wet while working the foredeck. All new 5/16in stainless steel stays were installed, with the addition of double headstays.</p>\n<p>“Having a <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/expert-advice/do-it-yourself-mast-stepping-86683\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mast stepped</a> on deck requires a strong support system to transfer the force, exerted through the mast, to the keel; The tabernacle was dismantled and rebuilt with heavy timbers. The mast head was strengthened. Two previous collisions with logs off the coast of Central America, suffering no damage, has given me confidence in hull strength. Nevertheless, the bow has been fortified with six layers of 24oz mat and epoxy resin,” he explained.</p>\n<p>“The purchase of sails, ground tackle, satellite navigation, <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/expert-advice/solar-panels-everything-you-need-to-know-24455\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">solar panels</a>, refrigeration, and a <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/expert-advice/how-to-use-ssb-radio-stay-in-touch-shore-71168\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ham radio</a>, helped deplete the money saved during the past seven years of working two jobs, seven days per week.</p>\n<p>“By departure date, the cruising budget diminished from $12,000 to $6,000. How can a world cruise be accomplished with a boatload of provisions and $6,000? Only five stops are planned, and money will only be spent on essentials. That’s my no-frills circumnavigation of the world.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93484\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93484\" class=\"wp-image-93484 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.ted_seymour_03_reader-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"Teddy Seymour sailing his yacht\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.ted_seymour_03_reader-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.ted_seymour_03_reader-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.ted_seymour_03_reader-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_profile_teddy.ted_seymour_03_reader.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93484\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Teddy Seymour spent 50 years living and sailing on <em>Love Song</em>.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "H.E. Ross looks at the lives of the first African American sailors to sail solo around the world\nCaptain Bill Pinkney (right) and Captain Teddy Seymour (left) broke barriers when they completed their voyages. Pinkney sailed via the five Great Capes, Seymour via the Panama and Suez Canals Credit: Maya Gates-Seymour/Capt Bill Pinkney/Chicago Maritime Museum\nCaptain Teddy Seymour and Captain Bill Pinkney both passed away in 2023 leaving a legacy that should be welcome applause to a point in history that sees too much conflict and division, writes H.E. Ross.\nTheir legacy could be said to be without a chance: they became the first African Americans to have sailed around the world single-handed.\nWhy emphasise African American in place of just sailor? Good question that I hope to answer in this article.\n“I started sailing in Puerto Rico and I loved it from the start,” Captain Bill Pinkney nods and continues, “I think it’s the independence of it. In sailing, you have absolute sovereignty. You have an opportunity to at least temporarily capture nature and bend it to your will. I say temporarily because nature changes. The sea’s calm and then it’s stormy. When you think you’ve mastered it, it masters you.”\nIf you met the very affable Bill Pinkney on the street or while trying to talk you into supporting one of his projects, you’d not think of him as a humble man.\n\nBill Pinkney has used his sailing experiences to inspire young people.

No, the one-time limbo exhibitionist and Revlon executive would not be the one facing the wall at a party.\nBut Pinkney was also dedicated to paving the way for children to be confident and not shy to get aboard sailing boats the way he was when he was young.\nOf course, building a dinghy and having to be rescued might have influenced the safety part of his push to get children into a real grasp of freedom offered by sailing, and away from the grasp of the street.\nFor his circumnavigation, Pinkney chose a cutter-rigged Valiant 47, named appropriately Lone Star.\nWhy did he choose this particular design and sail plan? The cutter rig of the Valiant provided a variety of sail options without too much handling on the deck.\nWith contributions from many, including the investment firm Alrich, Eastman & Waltch, he was able to purchase the Valiant 47.\nThis particular boat had solid offshore credentials; the boat had previously been sailed successfully and without much hardship by Captain Mark Schrader in the 1986-7 BOC Challenge.\n\nCapt Bill Pinkney wrote a children’s book about his circumnavigation just a few years before he died. Credit: Bill Pinkney/Chicago Maritime Museum\n\nWith the vision of owning this boat the direction of his project changed.\n“I was going to sail around with a 32ft boat, go through the Panama and Suez Canals and write to my grandchildren to tell them not only about where I was and what I was doing, but how I was using all of the things that I learned in the first 12 years of education.”\nBut using his mantra, ‘Never let a chance go by.’ he changed the concept, bought Lone Star, renamed her Commitment, changed rigging and equipment where needed and sailed 27,000 in a little less than a year and a half alone.\nHe was 55, with very little experience of sailing long distances alone, having mostly raced as crew or solo aboard his 28ft Pearson Triton in Lake Michigan.\nHis scheduled stops were at Salvador, Brazil, Cape Town in South Africa (where he memorably sailed past Nelson Mandela’s island prison of Robben Island, flying a spinnaker of red, black and green (the colours African Americans displayed in their struggle for freedom from second-class citizenship and discrimination), Hobart, Tasmania, and Punta del Este in Uruguay.\nWith further acumen, Pinkney moved the original concept to a greater one by giving sponsorship talks with the idea of then transmitting a daily passage report to 30,000 children.\nAt each stop, he’d send videotaped messages home to his wife, Ina, and the school children of Chicago and Boston; 700 students were on the dock at the Charlestown Navy Yard to greet him as he tied up Commitment behind the USS Constitution on his return.\n“The streets do offer a need for self-reliance and observance of ever-changing situations. I found that the youth who were court referrals grasped the concept of change faster than those I taught who did not have that need in everyday life.”\n\nCapt Bill Pinkney was the captain of the replica of La Amistad for two years, sailing the ship to Europe, Africa and the Caribbean. Credit: Associated Press/Alamy\n\nBill Pinkney was a man who came from the streets, with the single parent and poverty background that many see as destined to end only one way, but he went another way that showed alternatives that he was open to throughout his life.\n‘Never let a chance go by’ helped him sail around the five southernmost capes to tie up where he’d cast off.\nThen he went on to get sponsorships for his Middle Passage Project voyages to Africa, South America and the US to form an African studies curriculum for teachers who made the voyages.\nHis crowning achievement was to be the first skipper aboard the era-replicated Amistad and to meld that representation of a successful slave mutiny into a Middle Passage Project voyage under the auspices of the Mystic Seaport Museum. (The original ship, La Amistad, was seized by the authorities after Mende captives took control of the ship in Cuba and tried to sail it back to Africa. The subsequent court case became the first human rights case in the US Supreme Court, which was won by the Mende.)\nCaptain Pinkney emphasised the freedom aspect of the sailing world, “… that’s the identity that all of us who sail want. Religion, sexuality, colour, none of that has anything to do with the fact that, first and foremost, we’re sailors.”\nUnfortunately, written maritime history usually emphasises European maritime history.\nWe, up to this moment, still have to say Black maritime history to include what is being scantily researched about our involvement on the water.\nGoing back through time, Black mariner, Captain Alexander Leidesdorf sailed his schooner (with a crew) from New York to the village of Yerba Buena and after setting up trade routes between Mexico, Hawaii, Alaska and this little village he had the name officially changed back to the Spanish Mission name of San Francisco de Assisi.\nCaptain Leidesdorf is buried at Mission Dolores. Assisting the first successful slave revolt in Haiti was the first Black officer in the British Royal Navy, Captain John ‘Jack Punch’ Perkins who captured over 300 ships during his service.\nThe first back-to-Africa movement was accomplished by the Horatio Alger-type Captain Paul Cuffe who took them to Sierra Leone aboard one of his 11 ships.\nCuffe traded and whaled along the coast of Africa, the Mediterranean, the Baltic and even the slave-owning states in the newly founded United States of America.\nThe first six books written about the enslavement experience in America were written by Black mariners who understood and appreciated the concept of freedom.\n\nTeddy Seymour spent less than $6,000 during his 16-month voyage, and supplemented his stores of rice and beans with fish. Credit: Maya Gates-Seymour\n\nThough Teddy Seymour had a similar upbringing to Bill Pinkney, with his mother making sacrifices to ensure that her four children had just enough, Teddy had a more racially traumatic upbringing during his ghetto school years.\nLuckily, he saw that one spark that changed his world when his principal assigned him to athletics and his coach mentored him in such a way that he became a cross-country track star.\nThis earned young Teddy a scholarship, and with that acceptance and celebration by his college peers that in turn made him a happy student.\nIn 1965, Teddy Seymour joined the Marines and became an officer, as he held a diploma.\nEventually retiring from the Marines seven years later, he’d completed a tour in Vietnam, and was the 31st Black captain in the history of the Marine Corps, the oldest branch of services in the United States.\nHe started sailing with the Marines around Camp Pendleton in Southern California.\n\nTeddy Seymour spent 11 years modifying Love Song for solo sailing before his 1986-87 single-handed circumnavigation around the world via the Panama and Suez Canals. Credit: Maya Gates-Seymour\n\nAfter learning in a couple of dinghies he bought a Columbia 26 and lived aboard for his last two years in the Corps.\nHe then bought his Love Song, a Bruce King-Carl Alberg designed, Ericson 35 Mk1.\nHe took off and sailed down to Panama and across the Caribbean Basin to the US Virgin Islands where he taught in a primary school.\nHe then decided to sail around the world.\nAccording to his sister, Ruth, Teddy described himself as someone who takes risks and overcomes challenges to accomplish a goal. “He didn’t start out with the dream of sailing solo,” she said. “He just wanted to sail.”\n\nTeddy Seymour learned to sail in the US Marine Corps before buying his Ericson 35 Mk1. Credit: Maya Gates-Seymour\n\nThat is shown in his serious detailing and planning for a voyage that would happen seven years later. During those seven years, he accumulated most of the funds through saving and keeping his life simple.\n“A major decision was made during the summer of 1985, to become departure-date oriented. After the February 1986 departure date was set, the level of motivation reached zenith, and preparation activity heightened during several busy months.” Captain Seymour’s boat was generally sound as proven by his voyage from San Diego to the US Virgins.\n“My Ericson 35 is a solid, full keel boat. During 11 years of ownership, she has been heavily reinforced, modified, and equipped for solo cruising. The running rig was altered for the purpose of safety and convenience. Sails are hoisted by halyards tended from the cockpit. Lowering sails is also accomplished from the cockpit by pulling lines led to the head of the sails.\n“The mainsail is held on the boom by lazy jacks, and the jib is held on the deck by a net connected to the forward stanchions. This method reduces the possibility of being thrown overboard in a rough sea, and the displeasure of getting wet while working the foredeck. All new 5/16in stainless steel stays were installed, with the addition of double headstays.\n“Having a mast stepped on deck requires a strong support system to transfer the force, exerted through the mast, to the keel; The tabernacle was dismantled and rebuilt with heavy timbers. The mast head was strengthened. Two previous collisions with logs off the coast of Central America, suffering no damage, has given me confidence in hull strength. Nevertheless, the bow has been fortified with six layers of 24oz mat and epoxy resin,” he explained.\n“The purchase of sails, ground tackle, satellite navigation, solar panels, refrigeration, and a ham radio, helped deplete the money saved during the past seven years of working two jobs, seven days per week.\n“By departure date, the cruising budget diminished from $12,000 to $6,000. How can a world cruise be accomplished with a boatload of provisions and $6,000? Only five stops are planned, and money will only be spent on essentials. That’s my no-frills circumnavigation of the world.”\n\nTeddy Seymour spent 50 years living and sailing on Love Song. Credit: Maya Gates-Seymour\n\nIn the end, Teddy Seymour made 12 stops on his voyage, which took him via the Panama and Suez Canals to the likes of Bora Bora, Australia, Yemen, Israel and Egypt before returning to Frederiksted, St Croix, US Virgin Islands.\nHis 16-month circumnavigation was uneventful in terms of groundings and knockdowns, which he put down to his gear and planning.\nHe was later honoured by the likes of the Joshua Slocum Society and the Cruising Club of America but otherwise received little mention in the press apart from in a few sailing magazines, and returned to his job teaching and living on Love Song.\nCapt Teddy Seymour, born on 1 October 1941, and died on April 11, 2023 – The first Black man to circumnavigate the world solo, sailing from 24 February 1986 to 19 June 1987.\nCapt Bill Pinkney, born on 15 September, 1935, and died on 31 August 2023 – The first Black man to circumnavigate the world solo via the five southernmost capes, accomplished from 5 August 1990 to 9 June 1992.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nCircumnavigator Bill Pinkney dies aged 87\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBill Pinkney, who was the first black sailor to sail around the world solo via the five great southern capes,…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nMargaret and Frank Dye: open boat pioneers\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nRoger Barnes reflects on the legacy of small-boat sailors Margaret and Frank Dye\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nJessica Watson – the real sailor behind the True Spirit film\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhilst the new Netflix True Spirit movie was being filmed, celebrating Jessica Watson's real-life teenage solo, non-stop global circumnavigation, the…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nTributes to small boat legend John Guzzwell\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFair winds to trailblazing John Guzzwell, who in 1955 completed an unprecedented circumnavigation, aged 29, in a 21ft wooden yawl…\nWant to read more articles about amazing sailors?\n\nA subscription to Practical Boat Owner magazine costs around 40% less than the cover price.\nPrint and digital editions are available through Magazines Direct – where you can also find the latest deals.\nPBO is packed with information to help you get the most from boat ownership – whether sail or power.\nTake your DIY skills to the next level with trusted advice on boat maintenance and repairs\nImpartial in-depth gear reviews\nPractical cruising tips for making the most of your time afloat\nFollow us on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter",

It’s fair to say that most solo sailors will spend very little time at the helm unless they’re racing. There is a growing range of autopilots, from those driving the latest foiling race boats, with highly sophisticated software to the most modest tiller pilot. Whichever you have, go through the pain of RTFI (Reading The Flaming Instructions).

Learn how to use the tack and gybe functions or practice these manoeuvres using the +/-10°option to control the speed of the manoeuvre. Your autopilot may allow you to steer to a wind angle, meaning your heading will change as the wind shifts, or steer to a magnetic heading, leaving you to trim sails as the wind conditions change. Learn to adjust the rudder sensitivity or gain, this comes into its own as sea conditions change, especially for downwind sailing. If your autopilot is integrated it needs to be calibrated correctly with your other sensors for wind direction, rudder position, electronic compass etc. Autopilot remote control is a great upgrade allowing you to adjust the helm from anywhere on the boat, at the mast or in your bunk. Most also have a safety feature that will turn the boat into the wind if the skipper falls overboard, although I wouldn’t like to rely on it. One final note on autopilots is to never completely trust them. They are notorious for dropping out at seemingly random times, so always have one eye on the electronic crew member, at least until you get to know each other.</li>\n<li><strong>Wind vane steering</strong> For longer passages <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/gear/windvane-self-steering-a-complete-guide-for-sailors-90435\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wind vane steering</a> is arguably the best friend of the solo sailor.\n<div id=\"attachment_93427\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93427\" class=\"wp-image-93427 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.selfsteering_wws-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"A wind vane steering system on a boat\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.selfsteering_wws-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.selfsteering_wws-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.selfsteering_wws-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.selfsteering_wws.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93427\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wind vane steering is valuable for long-distance solo sailing.

A pair running the length of the cockpit will give you full range of movement and allow you to clip on before leaving the cabin.

Set up a permanently rigged boom preventer tail, about 2/3 the length of the boom, long enough to allow you to attach the new leeward preventer after a gybe by sitting safely on the coachroof.</li>\n<li><strong> Preventers</strong> Always lead the main preventer line all the way forward to the bow, never to the midships cleat or tow rail, which significantly increases the load on the boom and reduces its effectiveness. At the bow, route the preventer around a turning block and back to the cockpit to a winch. This will give you full control over the preventer when under load and from the cockpit.</li>\n<li><strong> Handholds and granny bars</strong> Adding more handholds, especially along the coachroof and even down the centreline of the foredeck, is a great addition to safety.\n<div id=\"attachment_93422\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93422\" class=\"wp-image-93422 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.grannybars_futureowns-630x355.jpg\" alt=\"Granny bars on the deck of a yacht\" width=\"630\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.grannybars_futureowns-630x355.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.grannybars_futureowns-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.grannybars_futureowns-768x433.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.grannybars_futureowns.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93422\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Granny bars close to the mast are very useful for solo sailing.

Be polite and professional, ask to use a working channel and remember to wish them a good watch as you sign off back to Ch16.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Personal safety equipment</h3>\n<p>Stay on the boat: this is the first and last rule of solo sailing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clip on</strong> I could say always wear a <a href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/gear/best-lifejackets-under-300-for-boaters-sailors-73284\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lifejacket</a> and, of course, that makes sense, but the first priority is to stay on board so always clip on.\n<div id=\"attachment_93426\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93426\" class=\"wp-image-93426 size-full\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.tether_futureowns.jpg\" alt=\"A woman wearing a lifejacket clipped on\" width=\"630\" height=\"840\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.tether_futureowns.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.tether_futureowns-150x200.jpg 150w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.tether_futureowns-300x400.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.tether_futureowns-375x500.jpg 375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93426\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">It’s always best to clip on when sailing solo. Credit: Katy Stickland</p></div>\n<p>To clip on you need a harness, this then gives you a choice of wearing a full lifejacket with an integrated harness or just a harness. There are some great harness-only options available that are easy to put on and lighter and more comfortable than a lifejacket, especially in hot weather.</li>\n<li><strong>Safety tethers</strong> Use a two-clip tether with both a long and short length. I like the tethers that have a loop to cow hitch to your harness, rather than a clip. This removes the temptation to go on deck without a tether or to inadvertently unclip both ends in the dark. I have clear memories of being on the foredeck during the Clipper Race and giving my tether to crew members, so they could make their way back to the cockpit while I recovered the tethers that had been ‘lost’ by unclipping both ends. In the confusion of a messy sail change, at night, it’s easily done when tired and a little overwhelmed by the conditions.</li>\n<li><strong> Lifejackets</strong> Buy a quality lifejacket and wear it. Also, learn how to service and check it yourself. There are a lot of great lifejackets on the market now, I personally like TeamO’s back-tow models that have a special device to turn you onto your back in the event of falling overboard while still tethered to the boat.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/yachts-and-gear/best-personal-locator-beacons-and-ais-units-top-options-for-boating-137237\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Personal locator beacons (PLBs)</strong> and AIS man overboard device (MoBs)</a> If the worst happens and you do end up in the water and away from the boat, and if you are wearing a lifejacket, the next challenge is to be found. Offshore chances are more remote, but for inshore waters, this is a real possibility so personal AIS MoB and PLB devices come into their own. When sailing in the Golden Globe Race, I tended to think about offshore and inshore safety differently; I always wore a lifejacket inshore, which had built-in AIS MOB and a PLB in my pouch on the belt. I’d have felt stupid if, after sailing halfway around the world, I then drowned within sight of land.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/gear-reviews/best-sailing-knives-multi-purpose-blades-boat-136675\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Carry a knife</strong></a> Fit it to your lifejacket belt or on a lanyard in a pocket.

Hydration is key to staying alert and you need to feed the machine to keep your energy levels up.</p>\n<p>Taking time to eat and drink during the day and the night is critical, so make it a priority.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93423\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93423\" class=\"wp-image-93423 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.food_futureowns-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"A man on a boat eating food from a bowl\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.food_futureowns-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.food_futureowns-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.food_futureowns-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.food_futureowns.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93423\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Make sure you prioritise food; easy-to-eat meals are best.

Credit: David Harding/Future</p></div>\n<p>This allows you to play the part of three people during a tack or a gybe.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tacking</strong> If you use the autopilot or the wind vane to <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/seamanship/the-changes-i-made-to-my-boat-to-get-it-to-tack-properly-87134\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tack the boat, it will probably be slower than tacking manually</a>. This can give you that extra moment to both cleanly release the old working sheet and haul in the new sheet just as the boat passes through the wind. The aim is to never let the headsail get outside of the lifelines leaving you with a flogging sail and a lot of winching to do.</li>\n<li><strong>Gybing</strong> The key to doing this single-handed is to forget the headsail, allowing it to back, while focusing on the mainsheet. It must be sheeted in close to the centre before the gybe and then released quickly but under control. Using the autopilot can be very useful here, taking the boat downwind in +10° increments while sheeting in the mainsail, then passing through the gybe with three or four quick presses of the button. Release the main under control and once the boat is back on a broad reach, bring the headsail over.</li>\n<li><strong> Cross-sheeting</strong> Consider cross-sheeting headsail lines to bring the working sheet to the high or windward side. This allows you to have one hand for the tiller and one for trimming the sheet. If this becomes a go-to technique, set up a turning block to bring the sheets across.</li>\n<li><strong>Reefing early and often</strong> This applies even more when sailing alone. Reefing early will keep your boat manageable and reduce the risk of accidents from being overpowered.\n<div id=\"attachment_93428\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93428\" class=\"wp-image-93428 size-full\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.reefing_futureowns.jpg\" alt=\"A person reefing a sail on a boat\" width=\"630\" height=\"947\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.reefing_futureowns.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.reefing_futureowns-133x200.jpg 133w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.reefing_futureowns-266x400.jpg 266w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.reefing_futureowns-333x500.jpg 333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93428\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">If you reef early, your boat will be easier to handle. Credit: Graham Snook/Future</p></div>\n<p>Your reefing procedure will depend on your boat’s set-up; you may be reefing at the mast or have lines brought back to the cockpit or a hybrid of both. Either way, remember you don’t need to come head-to-wind to reef, that is the last thing you want to do in a big seaway and it will leave your main flogging horribly. Simply depower the mainsail, by easing the sheet, vang off and topping lift on, then lower the halyard and secure reefing lines depending on your system. What you are looking to achieve is tight luff, without any horizontal wrinkles, and the foot of the sail should be flat and snug against the boom, sitting on top of the bunt of the sail. The whole operation should only take a few minutes at most.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/seamanship/heaving-to-a-question-of-balance-87553\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong> Heaving-to</strong></a> This is an invaluable skill for the solo sailor and it’s not just for heavy weather. Take time to find how your boat likes to heave-to and use it whenever you want to hit pause for a while, rest, sort out an engine that won’t start or calmly organise your lines and fenders before going into the marina.</li>\n<li><strong> Balancing the sails</strong> This is even more important if you are using an autopilot or a wind vane most of the time. Badly balanced sails will create excessive weather helm forcing the autohelm to work harder, dragging more rudder through the water, both slowing the boat down and using more battery power. Adjust trim carefully. When the boat feels good to sail and light on the tiller, then engage the autohelm or wind vane and put the kettle on.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Boat handling</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/seamanship/solo-sailing-tips-anchoring-and-berthing-88353\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Leaving the dock and coming alongside is where planning and preparation really meets performance</a>.</p>\n<p>Make sure you visualise what’s going to be happening with the tide and the breeze and form your plan before you ever step aboard.</p>\n<p>There are no rules to say you must do this solo, don’t hesitate to ask for some help with your lines or be shy to radio ahead to the marina office and ask for a helping hand.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93418\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93418\" class=\"wp-image-93418 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.berthing_futureowns-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"A boat being moored alongside a pontoon\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.berthing_futureowns-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.berthing_futureowns-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.berthing_futureowns-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.feat_crew_to_solo.berthing_futureowns.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93418\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Do not hesitate to ask for help with lines when coming alongside.

Assuming you are bows into your slip, use an additional mooring line (leave your other lines alone for the moment) from a point mid-cockpit, such as sheet winch, and run it around a pontoon cleat near the stern and back to the winch ready to slip. Put the boat in forward tick over and she will pin herself against the pontoon. Adjust engine revs as needed, and when you are happy remove the bow and stern lines and step aboard. You should be able to reach the tiller and engine controls. Hold the short spring line ready to slip on the winch, put the engine into neutral and start to slip, and then reverse as you slip the line clear.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/seamanship/coming-alongside-sailing-skills-for-shorthanded-crews-67044\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Coming alongside</strong></a> Now is where the midships cleat is so useful.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Round the world sailor Ian Herbert-Jones shares valuable advice on how to transition from crewed to single-handed sailing\nSingle-handed sailing allows you the freedom to set your own course – no crew required – and embrace new adventures. Credit: Richard Langdon/Ocean Images\nSailing solo isn’t just for the elite Vendée Globe athletes or the sailing loners of the Golden Globe Race, writes Ian Herbert-Jones.\nIt’s an adventure waiting for anyone with the drive to challenge themselves and the desire for the freedom to sail whenever they choose crew or no crew.\nWith the right preparation, a few smart modifications, and a determined mindset, sailing solo is achievable and rewarding.\nStarting solo sailing can feel overwhelming, but set yourself a challenge by beginning with short, local trips to build your confidence over time.\nMy journey to sailing alone started with a bit of a challenge: I signed up to participate in the 2022 Golden Globe Race despite having exactly zero solo sailing miles at the time.\n\nIan Herbert-Jones sailed solo across three oceans until Puffin was dismasted 900 miles off the Falkland Islands. Credit: Jane Zhou/Don McIntyre/GGR\n\nMy first solo passage was a modest 80-mile round trip across Cardigan Bay.\nDropping anchor at sunset in New Quay and then sipping coffee in the cockpit at sunrise, just my Tradewind 35, Puffin and I, alone for the first time, is something I’ll never forget. That was it, I was hooked.\nThe Fastnet rock followed, then the Azores and so it went on.\nWith each trip I refined my skills, learning from mistakes and adapting my procedures and the boat’s setup, until eventually I had logged the 4,000 solo miles needed to qualify for the race and found myself slipping lines in Les Sables d’Olonne for the solo voyage of a lifetime.\nTake a friend when starting solo sailing\nIt may seem counterintuitive, but taking a friend (just one though) along on your initial ‘solo’ training is really helpful.\nThey can act as a safety backup and provide support as you develop solo techniques.\nWork through each manoeuvre, from hoisting the mainsail to docking, until you have a step-by-step ‘solo’ procedure for every task.\nMake your own solo sailing manual and laminate key manoeuvres to stick on the bulkhead or chart table.\n\nTake someone with you so you can practise sailing solo and become comfortable with handling the boat on your own. Credit: David Harding\n\nMany things will be second nature but remember you’re going to be alone with no one to point out what you’ve missed or to remind you of what comes next.\nIf you are mindful of this process, it will also help you work out any changes you want to make to the boat’s running rigging and systems. Do nothing new.\nTry not to do anything for the first time when solo – once you have a procedure try to stick to it every time, allow the muscle memory to develop and then you can refine your techniques or the gear over time.\nChoosing the right boat for sailing solo\nWhat is the ideal boat for solo sailing? The answer, of course, is the boat you already have, at least to start with.\nWhile some boats have been developed specifically to be sailed short-handed, such as the Mini 6.5 or the Beneteau Figaro, almost any boat can be adapted for solo sailing, although certain characteristics will make handling easier.\nWhen it comes to size, I feel less is more.\n\nTiller steering is generally preferred by solo sailors. Credit: Richard Langdon/Ocean Images\n\nGenerally, smaller boats, between 23ft and 40ft are easier to manage alone and yet still very capable of making decent passages.\nAbove this size loads begin to increase dramatically, and everything becomes less forgiving.\nSimplicity is also key; boats with straightforward systems and minimal complexity are preferable.\nYou may be tempted by designs that seem to allow for easier sail handling, such as self-tacking jibs or in-mast or boom furling systems, but I would argue against these; it is best to keep it all as simple as possible.\nA tiller offers direct steering with fewer potential issues than a wheel and is very often favoured by solo sailors.\nIn the cockpit layout, essential controls such as mainsheet, traveller and jib sheets should all be within easy reach.\nEquipment for solo sailing\nElectronic autopilot An electronic autopilot will make the transition to solo sailing far safer and less stressful. It’s fair to say that most solo sailors will spend very little time at the helm unless they’re racing. There is a growing range of autopilots, from those driving the latest foiling race boats, with highly sophisticated software to the most modest tiller pilot. Whichever you have, go through the pain of RTFI (Reading The Flaming Instructions). Given that the autopilot is your only other crew member, it’s a good idea to get to know each other a little.\n\nAn autopilot remote control allows helm adjustment from anywhere on board. Credit: Paul Wyeth\n\nWith crew on board, many of us only know how to go from Auto (ie On) to Standby (ie Off). Learn how to use the tack and gybe functions or practice these manoeuvres using the +/-10°option to control the speed of the manoeuvre. Your autopilot may allow you to steer to a wind angle, meaning your heading will change as the wind shifts, or steer to a magnetic heading, leaving you to trim sails as the wind conditions change. Learn to adjust the rudder sensitivity or gain, this comes into its own as sea conditions change, especially for downwind sailing. If your autopilot is integrated it needs to be calibrated correctly with your other sensors for wind direction, rudder position, electronic compass etc. Autopilot remote control is a great upgrade allowing you to adjust the helm from anywhere on the boat, at the mast or in your bunk. Most also have a safety feature that will turn the boat into the wind if the skipper falls overboard, although I wouldn’t like to rely on it. One final note on autopilots is to never completely trust them. They are notorious for dropping out at seemingly random times, so always have one eye on the electronic crew member, at least until you get to know each other.\nWind vane steering For longer passages wind vane steering is arguably the best friend of the solo sailor.\n\nWind vane steering is valuable for long-distance solo sailing. Credit: Peter Poland\n\nIt steers all day, doesn’t eat anything or use any power and never answers back. However, assuming you have an autopilot, don’t feel you need a wind vane as you first transition to solo sailing – that can come later.\n A bombproof mainsail reefing system It’s essential to be able to reef on any point of sail, including downwind. A mainsail that won’t come down could turn into a serious safety issue. Invest in mainsail cars and sliders. Your reefing system needs to be simple, low friction and not require you to be in two places at once.\n Furling headsail Despite not being a fan of the in-boom or in-mast furling, I can’t deny the obvious advantages of furling headsails of all kinds. Ensure the furling line is routed to reduce friction and can be secured so there is no possibility of it escaping and letting your genoa unfurl in 40 knots of breeze.\n Self-tailing winches These are crucial on larger boats, allowing you to handle sails with one hand while keeping the other for the helm or yourself.\n Boom breaks or gybe preventers Not common on crewed boats, but consider one of these as an extra fuse in your system.\n\nBoom breaks add in an extra layer of security to prevent a crash gybe when solo sailing. Credit: Rachael Sprot\n\nConditions can change rapidly, autopilots can fail and before you know it the boom is demonstrating the power of an unintentional gybe, breaking the gooseneck or worse.\n AIS This is one of the most important items of safety gear for solo sailing. It gives you – and importantly other vessels – vital information to make good collision avoidance decisions in a timely fashion.\n\nAIS is essential if you’re sailing solo\n\nMost AIS systems will also allow you to set audible alarms alerting you to a developing risk of collision.\nActive radar target enhancer This can make your tiny GRP sailing boat look more like a big steel fishing boat on a ship’s radar.\n Alarms Modern chart plotters allow alarms to be set for changes in the wind direction, wind speed or the boat’s course. This alerts us to trim sails, or to the fact that the autopilot has decided to drop out. n Alarm clocks You need to sleep at some point and be woken in a 100% reliable way. Simple mechanical kitchen timers work well and pro sailors now use hard-wired alarm systems. Alarms need to be placed well away from where you rest, forcing you to get up for a visual check.\nReliable communications Make sure your VHF and DSC work correctly. The one-press red DSC button is all you may have time for in a serious incident. A handheld VHF radio, ideally attached to your lifejacket, is also good to have.\nWhistling kettle When you’re distracted it’s easy to forget you put the kettle on.\nSetting up your boat for solo sailing\n\nEssential control lines should be in easy reach of the cockpit. Credit: David Harding\n\nEven small adjustments to the boat’s set-up can make a huge difference in reducing physical strain and keeping you in control.\n Lines to the cockpit While running all lines to the cockpit may seem ideal, it can really increase friction resulting in the need to go forward to the mast to pull down the mainsail or free up reefing lines at the gooseneck. This leaves you needing to be in two places at once. It’s better to keep reefing simple and at the mast, where you can position yourself securely, see exactly what’s going on, help the sail down, and deal with reefing lines and halyards all in one place.\n Mark your lines Mark halyards and reefing lines with a permanent marker or whipping to indicate proper positions for each reef and consider choosing colour-coding lines for easy identification. If you do have a ram’s horn and ring combination, consider converting the horn to a carabiner on a short strop; this allows you to clip on the tack ring, avoiding its tendency to jump off the horn, before tensioning the halyard and the reef clew line.\n\nMarking halyards where they exit the lower part of the mast allows you to determine how tight they are\n\nA solid boom vang can remove the need for a topping lift and make sail handling easier. It also allows the topping lift to be kept as a spare main halyard. Lazy jacks can also make life much easier when hoisting and dropping the main. They need careful thought when first setting up to ensure they won’t foul the aft end of the mainsail battens. Also, rig the lazy jacks so they can be pulled forward to the mast and kept out of the way if needed.\nJack lines Staying on the boat is the only option when sailing solo, so give your jacklines some serious thought. Rig them as close to the centre line of the boat as possible, so when tethered you can’t fall far enough to get over or under the lifelines.\n\nRig jacklines close to the boat’s centreline. Credit: Jake Kavanagh\n\nHave multiple sets of jacklines to cover each area of the boat. A pair running the length of the cockpit will give you full range of movement and allow you to clip on before leaving the cabin. For going forward, rig a single jackline across the middle of the coachroof to the mast and pair on the side decks, as inboard as possible, and finally another down the centre line of the foredeck.\nPre-rigged boom preventer tails Although I suggest a boom break is worth considering, you should still be ready to set a full boom preventer when needed. Set up a permanently rigged boom preventer tail, about 2/3 the length of the boom, long enough to allow you to attach the new leeward preventer after a gybe by sitting safely on the coachroof.\n Preventers Always lead the main preventer line all the way forward to the bow, never to the midships cleat or tow rail, which significantly increases the load on the boom and reduces its effectiveness. At the bow, route the preventer around a turning block and back to the cockpit to a winch. This will give you full control over the preventer when under load and from the cockpit.\n Handholds and granny bars Adding more handholds, especially along the coachroof and even down the centreline of the foredeck, is a great addition to safety.\n\nGranny bars close to the mast are very useful for solo sailing. Credit: Graham Snook/Future\n\nThe same goes for the cabin, allowing you to monkey swing from handhold to handhold as you move about. If you’re going to reef at the mast, consider fitting granny bars – you will come to love them.\nCentre cleats It might seem like a mundane upgrade, but the humble centre cleat will pay you back so many times when it comes to short-handed docking.\nManaging risk alone at sea\nSafety is always critical, but solo sailing further reduces your margin for error.\nPreparing for potential issues and mitigating risks is essential.\nWatchkeeping: this is part of the vital self-discipline that is needed in solo sailing. You are 100% responsible for your own safety and that of others out on the water.\n\nIf sailing inshore or near shipping lanes, you should be checking the horizon for other boats at least every 20 minutes. Credit: Getty\n\nWe should all know what the COLREGS require of us – being tired and alone is not an excuse.\nBuild active watchkeeping into your procedures aboard. Don’t get too comfortable under the dodger or at the chart table, even if you do have a chart plotter and AIS in front of you.\nInshore or near shipping lanes, the 20-minute rule is a good standard to aim for.\n\nRadio a boat to make clear your intentions, if needed. Credit: Andrew Sydenham\n\nGetting into the cockpit for a visual check of the full horizon will also keep you alert to changing weather conditions.\nSet AIS and radar collision alarms for additional security but avoid relying on them solely.\nTake early action When managing busy traffic, taking action early is key. Don’t allow a situation to develop that’s going to require you to make a rushed manoeuvre. It’s good to talk: I love AIS for its ability to give me a ship’s name and call sign. Don’t hesitate to call a vessel on VHF radio to explain your intentions; the officer of the watch will either reassure you that they are monitoring you and will pass safely, or they’ll alter course slightly to give you a wider berth. Be polite and professional, ask to use a working channel and remember to wish them a good watch as you sign off back to Ch16.\nPersonal safety equipment\nStay on the boat: this is the first and last rule of solo sailing.\nClip on I could say always wear a lifejacket and, of course, that makes sense, but the first priority is to stay on board so always clip on.\n\nIt’s always best to clip on when sailing solo. Credit: Katy Stickland\n\nTo clip on you need a harness, this then gives you a choice of wearing a full lifejacket with an integrated harness or just a harness. There are some great harness-only options available that are easy to put on and lighter and more comfortable than a lifejacket, especially in hot weather.\nSafety tethers Use a two-clip tether with both a long and short length. I like the tethers that have a loop to cow hitch to your harness, rather than a clip. This removes the temptation to go on deck without a tether or to inadvertently unclip both ends in the dark. I have clear memories of being on the foredeck during the Clipper Race and giving my tether to crew members, so they could make their way back to the cockpit while I recovered the tethers that had been ‘lost’ by unclipping both ends. In the confusion of a messy sail change, at night, it’s easily done when tired and a little overwhelmed by the conditions.\n Lifejackets Buy a quality lifejacket and wear it. Also, learn how to service and check it yourself. There are a lot of great lifejackets on the market now, I personally like TeamO’s back-tow models that have a special device to turn you onto your back in the event of falling overboard while still tethered to the boat.\nPersonal locator beacons (PLBs) and AIS man overboard device (MoBs) If the worst happens and you do end up in the water and away from the boat, and if you are wearing a lifejacket, the next challenge is to be found. Offshore chances are more remote, but for inshore waters, this is a real possibility so personal AIS MoB and PLB devices come into their own. When sailing in the Golden Globe Race, I tended to think about offshore and inshore safety differently; I always wore a lifejacket inshore, which had built-in AIS MOB and a PLB in my pouch on the belt. I’d have felt stupid if, after sailing halfway around the world, I then drowned within sight of land.\nCarry a knife Fit it to your lifejacket belt or on a lanyard in a pocket. Ideally, it should have a fixed serrated blade with a rounded, blunt tip.\nManaging fatigue\nRemember that sailing alone can be more mentally and physically tiring than sailing with a crew, even on short passages.\nOne of the greatest challenges of solo sailing is managing fatigue; it’s critical not only for your comfort and enjoyment but also for your safety.\nIt is important to stay hydrated and fed. Hydration is key to staying alert and you need to feed the machine to keep your energy levels up.\nTaking time to eat and drink during the day and the night is critical, so make it a priority.\n\nMake sure you prioritise food; easy-to-eat meals are best. Credit: Pete Goss\n\nPrepare easy-to-eat meals and snacks in advance, have a few freeze-dried emergency meals on standby in case things get rough, and consider using caffeine more strategically, saving it for when you really need it.\nBeing overtired can be compared with being drunk when it comes to decision-making.\nBalance tasks with moments of rest and avoid pushing through exhaustion.\nWhen inshore, I find that a cycle of 20 minutes of ‘sleep’ and 10 minutes of being up works well.\nI get up, check the AIS and chart plotter on my way to the cockpit, and then check the horizon, the weather and the sail trim before going back to my bunk, almost without waking up.\nDoing this during hours of darkness means that I could get around five hours of ‘rest’ (not necessarily sleep) in an eight-hour night.\nI can then continue the process during the day as needed.\nFurther offshore I’d extend this to 30 and 40 minutes with longer, real sleeps, once away from the shipping lanes.\nSail techniques\nRemember that slow is pro. Slowing down any procedure, and breaking it into a series of steps, can help you manage a manoeuvre in a smooth, unhurried way.\n\nHeaving-to will allow you to pause and rest, if needed. Credit: David Harding/Future\n\nThis allows you to play the part of three people during a tack or a gybe.\nTacking If you use the autopilot or the wind vane to tack the boat, it will probably be slower than tacking manually. This can give you that extra moment to both cleanly release the old working sheet and haul in the new sheet just as the boat passes through the wind. The aim is to never let the headsail get outside of the lifelines leaving you with a flogging sail and a lot of winching to do.\nGybing The key to doing this single-handed is to forget the headsail, allowing it to back, while focusing on the mainsheet. It must be sheeted in close to the centre before the gybe and then released quickly but under control. Using the autopilot can be very useful here, taking the boat downwind in +10° increments while sheeting in the mainsail, then passing through the gybe with three or four quick presses of the button. Release the main under control and once the boat is back on a broad reach, bring the headsail over.\n Cross-sheeting Consider cross-sheeting headsail lines to bring the working sheet to the high or windward side. This allows you to have one hand for the tiller and one for trimming the sheet. If this becomes a go-to technique, set up a turning block to bring the sheets across.\nReefing early and often This applies even more when sailing alone. Reefing early will keep your boat manageable and reduce the risk of accidents from being overpowered.\n\nIf you reef early, your boat will be easier to handle. Credit: Graham Snook/Future\n\nYour reefing procedure will depend on your boat’s set-up; you may be reefing at the mast or have lines brought back to the cockpit or a hybrid of both. Either way, remember you don’t need to come head-to-wind to reef, that is the last thing you want to do in a big seaway and it will leave your main flogging horribly. Simply depower the mainsail, by easing the sheet, vang off and topping lift on, then lower the halyard and secure reefing lines depending on your system. What you are looking to achieve is tight luff, without any horizontal wrinkles, and the foot of the sail should be flat and snug against the boom, sitting on top of the bunt of the sail. The whole operation should only take a few minutes at most.\n Heaving-to This is an invaluable skill for the solo sailor and it’s not just for heavy weather. Take time to find how your boat likes to heave-to and use it whenever you want to hit pause for a while, rest, sort out an engine that won’t start or calmly organise your lines and fenders before going into the marina.\n Balancing the sails This is even more important if you are using an autopilot or a wind vane most of the time. Badly balanced sails will create excessive weather helm forcing the autohelm to work harder, dragging more rudder through the water, both slowing the boat down and using more battery power. Adjust trim carefully. When the boat feels good to sail and light on the tiller, then engage the autohelm or wind vane and put the kettle on.\nBoat handling\nLeaving the dock and coming alongside is where planning and preparation really meets performance.\nMake sure you visualise what’s going to be happening with the tide and the breeze and form your plan before you ever step aboard.\nThere are no rules to say you must do this solo, don’t hesitate to ask for some help with your lines or be shy to radio ahead to the marina office and ask for a helping hand.\n\nDo not hesitate to ask for help with lines when coming alongside. Credit: David Harding/Future\n\nIf you do take help, remember you’re still the skipper; brief the new shore crew on exactly what you want them to do, and don’t allow anyone to use their imagination. The same rules apply to coming alongside.\nA ‘drive-by’ is useful to allow you to assess tide and wind effects before committing yourself.\nIf you’re not sure of the final berth, prepare lines and fenders on both sides and if you’re not happy with the spot you’ve been given, find another berth, wait for slack water and move again if needed.\n Slipping lines One approach to slipping lines is the short stern spring method. Assuming you are bows into your slip, use an additional mooring line (leave your other lines alone for the moment) from a point mid-cockpit, such as sheet winch, and run it around a pontoon cleat near the stern and back to the winch ready to slip. Put the boat in forward tick over and she will pin herself against the pontoon. Adjust engine revs as needed, and when you are happy remove the bow and stern lines and step aboard. You should be able to reach the tiller and engine controls. Hold the short spring line ready to slip on the winch, put the engine into neutral and start to slip, and then reverse as you slip the line clear.\nComing alongside Now is where the midships cleat is so useful. One go-to method when single-handed is to rig a long line, made off on the stern cleat outside the lifelines and back through the middle of the midships cleat and to a cockpit winch.\n\nThe midships cleat is useful for coming alongside\n\nThis loop creates a stern spring and a midships line in one. Give yourself plenty of slack and drop or lasso the loop over the first cleat on a finger pontoon as you come alongside. Follow this with a blast of reverse, then quickly pull in the slack around the winch. Put the engine into forward tick over and the boat will be pinned against the dock, allowing you to sort out the lines at your own pace.\nEmbrace the challenge of solo sailing\nTransitioning from crewed to solo sailing is challenging, but the rewards are immense.\nWith a little prior preparation and practice, sailing solo becomes a skill that opens up the freedom to set your own course – no crew required – and embrace some new adventures.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nComing alongside – essential skills for shorthanded crews\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nComing alongside can be tricky for singlehanded and short-handed sailors. Øyvind Bordal has some sailing skills that will come in…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBoat towing and berthing by tender\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIf your engine fails to start, being able to berth your boat using the tender is an extremely useful skill,…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nCruising chute or spinnaker?

    "content:encodedSnippet": "15 skippers are expected to leave Antigua to sail around the world in the Mini Globe Race 2025, aboard 5.8m home-built plywood yachts\nHull No 1, Trekka, will be sailed in the Mini Globe Race 2025. Credit: Aïda Valceanu / CG580\nIn the 1950s, John Guzzwell proved that sub-21-foot boats could sail around the world with his adventures aboard Trekka, and in February, 15 skippers will follow in his footsteps when they participate in the Mini Globe Race 2025.\nGuzzwell built Trekka from Laurent Giles’s plans for a 20ft 6in yawl, doing all the work himself before sailing the yacht from Victoria, British Columbia to Hawaii via San Francisco.\nOver the following four years, Guzwell sailed 33,000 miles crossing the the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans, transiting the Panama Canal and sailing back to Victoria via Hawaii in 1959. He wrote about his voyages in Trekka Around the World.\n\nPlans for John Guzwell’s Trekka. Credit: John Guzwell/Mini Globe Race\n\nDon McIntyre, who founded the Golden Globe Race and Ocean Globe Race, is also behind the Mini Globe Race 2025.\nThe Australian sailor has long been a fan of Guzwell, who died last week at the age of 94. A few days before, Guzwell had agreed to be the patron of the Mini Globe Race.\n“As I was thinking of John with the sun setting, he passed away. “Sail On John”…we will all be thinking of you and your passion for life and adventure during the Mini Globe Race,” wrote McIntyre.\nAll those taking part in the Mini Globe Race 2025 will be sailing identical one design Class Globe 580 yachts.\nDesigned by Polish naval architect, Janusz Maderski, the 19ft Globe 580 is built using a basic plywood epoxy construction, bow crash box, three watertight compartments, six full frames, two watertight bulkheads, pine stringers and oak floors.\nThe plans cost from €300. Builders can also opt for a CNC pre-cut plywood kit. To date, over 80 yachts are in various stages of completion, with about 20 in the water and another 140 builders with plans.\nSome of the Mini Globe Race 2025 skippers have already built their Globe 580s, including British sailor Adam Waugh, Australian father and son, Mike and John Blenkinsop, Canadian Dan Turk, Australian Dan Turner and Swiss sailor Renaud Stitelmann, while others still have their boats in build, like German Christian Sauer.\n\nAdam Waugh built Little Wren himself and is currently making his final preparations ahead of the race start. Credit: Adam Waugh\n\nAll entrants undergo survival and medical training, comprehensive medical checks, and stress tests before taking part.\nThe Mini Globe Race 2025 Notice of Race prohibits the use of electronic wind instruments and logs, hydro generators and watermakers. Solar panel capacity is limited to 200 watts; only a 200-amp battery is allowed.\nUnlike some solo races, entrants sail independently, with each sailor responsible for their voyage plan, logistics and safety management, overseen by individually appointed safety managers. They can make unpenalised stops, but the race clock will continue to run.\nSafety managers report to the Mini Globe Race 2025 event management but maintain primary responsibility for their sailors around the clock.\nEntrants will also need to finish the solo 3,600-mile Mini Globe qualifying race, solo across the Atlantic.\nThe Globe 5.80 Transat started on 28 December from Marina de Lagos in Portugal to Marina Rubicon in Lanzarote, Canary Islands, before concluding at the National Sailing Academy, Antigua.\n\nThe legs of the Mini Globe Race 2025. Credit: MGR\n\nThe Mini Globe Race 2025 will begin from Antigua on 23 February 2025.\nThe first leg takes sailors to Shelter Bay Marina, Panama, where yachts will be transported overland to the Pacific Ocean.\nThe second leg, starting on March 23, 2025, covers 6,500 miles to VUDA Marina in Fiji, with mandatory pit stops in the Marquesas, Tahiti, and Tonga. Each pit stop requires an eight-day minimum stay, allowing sailors to rest and make repairs.\nThe third leg spans 10,000 miles to Cape Town, South Africa, with stops in Darwin, Mauritius, and Durban.\nGiven the challenging weather conditions and the notorious Agulhas current, an additional 10 days of pit stops are allowed.\nThe fourth and final leg of 7,000 miles begins on December 22, 2025, with stops in St. Helena and Recife, Brazil, before the final sprint back to Antigua, with the first boat expected to cross the line by late March 2026.\n\nAustralian father and son, John and Mike Blenkinsop have built two Globe 580 yachts to take part in the Mini Globe Race 2025. Both boats are now undergoing sea trials. Credit: John Blenkinsop\n\n“The Mini Globe Race (MGR), like the Golden Globe Race, will be a voyage of attrition. I have great faith in the sailors, the boats, and the meticulous planning that has gone into this event over the past five years,” said McIntyre.\n“The Globe 580 yachts are robust, safe and fun to sail, offering an affordable challenge. The McIntyre MGR is an exciting companion to our two other unique around-the-world races, closing the loop and now offering true adventures to all sections of sailing. 10 years ago, I set out to bring back affordable, human around the world racing that was truly sustainable for all sailors, where money and speed at all costs is not the driving force. All three events GGR, OGR and now MGR are epic human stories,” he added.\nMini Globe Race 2025 skippers\nAdam Waugh (UK) sailing Little Wren, which he built himself\nChristian Sauer (Germany) sailing Argo (still in build)\nDan Turk (Canada) sailing Little Bea, which he built himself\nDaniel Turner (Australia) sailing Immortal Game, which he built himself\nEric Marsh (Australia) sailing SunBear, which was built by Michael Moyer, who sailed the boat in the Globe 5.80 Transat 2023\nErtan Beskardes (UK) sailing Trekka, hull no 1 which was built for Don McIntyre.

However, the fittings were placed carefully so that other structures behind offered support.</p>\n<p>A little research soon came up with a piece on the Jeanneau owners’ website, where a New Zealand owner had used Rutgerson fittings to do exactly what I planned.</p>\n<p>The Rutgerson gear even had an option of cast end plates to mount the track spanning the cockpit.</p>\n<p>The only downside was the cost – nearly £300 for the castings alone.</p>\n<p>Instead, I opted to use Harken gear to match the boat’s existing winches and have the brackets and backing plates custom-made in stainless steel – at half the price.</p>\n<p>A word here on the selection of the track: most manufacturers produce ‘high beam’ versions of their track for use when spanning cockpits.</p>\n<p>These are more expensive but are of a heavier section and engineered to carry the loads of an unsupported span.</p>\n<p>Check with the manufacturer that the track will suit your sail area and cockpit span.</p>\n<p>Harken publishes this data online and in their catalogue. If in doubt a phone call or email will quickly get the facts. I found all the manufacturers helpful during the initial planning stages.</p>\n<p>Careful measurements were made of the cockpit sides, which are not vertical, and from these, I produced some working drawings.</p>\n<p>These were given to the stainless steel fabricators, along with a short section of the track to ensure a perfect fit during manufacture.</p>\n<p>As 8mm stainless steel drop nose pins would be used to hold the track in place, for simplicity I also used 8mm bolts for mounting the brackets though the GRP.</p>\n<p>When correctly fitted the drop pins would not be taking any vertical load as this would be carried by the track bearing on the upper face of the bracket.</p>\n<p>However, they would be carrying a horizontal load – hence the need for some fairly chunky ones.</p>\n<p>Having selected the best location with regard to the position of the wheel, I drilled a single hole to locate the first bracket.</p>\n<p>I then cut the track to length and clamped it to the first bracket. I clamped the second bracket to the other end of the mainsheet track, and then took great care to not only measure the location of the second bracket but to ensure that it looked right from all angles by sighting against fixed lines such as that made by the base of the companionway.</p>\n<p>Once the position was determined I drilled a hole and bolted the second bracket in place.</p>\n<p>Now I could remove the track and drill the remaining holes.</p>\n<p>After a final dry fit to check alignment, the plates were degreased and sealant added before I bolted them into place.</p>\n<p>They were tightened lightly and then left for a couple of hours to allow the sealant to start to go off before further work. I used Nyloc nuts in the locker but, for a more pleasing finish, used dome nuts and spring washers in the aft cabin where they’d be seen.</p>\n<p>After a final tighten of the nuts I clamped the mainsheeet track back in place and drilled the holes through the track for the drop nose pins.</p>\n<p>I drilled from each side using the hole in the bracket as a guide, before running the drill right through to check alignment.</p>\n<p>I then removed the mainsheet track once more to clean up any burred edges.</p>\n<p>The track ends were then secured according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the mainsheet blocks added.</p>\n<p>I opted for blocks by ‘Easy’ as these were half the price of the Harken equivalents.</p>\n<p>The system has a double jammer on the lower block and gives the option of either a 3:1 purchase if both tails are hauled, or a 6:1 purchase if only one tail is hauled. A case of speed or ease – your choice!</p>\n<p>The two ends were spliced to form a continuous loop for convenience (I did this myself as it really is a simple splice to make).</p>\n<p>I fitted a Lewmar snap shackle to the lower block so that it can be quickly released and taken to the guardrail before removing the track.</p>\n<p>The new mainsheert track has been a big success.</p>\n<p>Sheeting the main for better shape and control is much easier from the helm, allowing the sail to be feathered down the track, or even dumped to maintain control in gusty conditions.</p>\n<p>Anne likes it as the cockpit can be cleared in a matter of seconds once alongside.</p>\n<p>On the downside there is a lot of rope in the cockpit – but part of the fun of a sailing boat is pulling the bits of string!</p>\n<h3>The skill level needed for fitting a removable mainsheet track</h3>\n<p>The design element relies on careful measurements with ruler, pencil and set square.</p>\n<p>For the rest, it’s just drilling holes in the correct place and cutting the track square, all fairly straightforward stuff and well within the capabilities of most people.</p>\n<p>Do take time to make sure that the proposed location is strong enough to carry the expected loads.</p>\n<p>In my case, the mid-boom sheeting on the coachroof imposes roughly twice the load of an end-boom sheeting arrangement in the cockpit.</p>\n<p>This mid-boom load is taken by two relatively small eyebolts bolted through the coachroof with no particular reinforcing structure below.</p>\n<p>So this, combined with my inspection of the Sun Fast 32, gave me confidence that my proposed location would be plenty strong enough.</p>\n<p>The total time to fit was around five hours from start to finish and included a break for a bacon and egg bap while the sealant cured.</p>\n<p><strong>Installing a mainsheet track: Step-by-step</strong></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-93307 size-full\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edfig-16-hi-res.jpg\" alt=\"Rigging on a yacht\" width=\"630\" height=\"840\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edfig-16-hi-res.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edfig-16-hi-res-150x200.jpg 150w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edfig-16-hi-res-300x400.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edfig-16-hi-res-375x500.jpg 375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 3\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>1.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "When your boat’s mainsheet arrangement doesn’t quite do the job it’s not difficult to improve upon it yourself. Here’s how Bob Goode devised his own\nTrimming the mainsail from the helm single- handed is easy with a cockpit mainsheet track. Credit: Bob Goode\nIn common with many yachts, my Jeanneau Sun Odyssey 32 had a bridle arrangement for sheeting the mainsail, using padeyes in front of the spray hood, writes Bob Goode.\nThis is undoubtedly cheap for the manufacturer and does at least keep the cockpit clear of lines when sailing.\nIt has some major drawbacks though: it is less than ideal for getting good shape from the sail and it is impossible for the person at the helm to reach if the wind has to be spilled in a gust.\nA track-mounted mainsheet is the way to go, but if located ahead of the hatch it’s still impossible for the helmsman to reach.\nOne mounted across the cockpit is ideal from the sailing perspective but my wife, Anne, was dead set against this as it would ‘clutter up the cockpit’ for in-harbour lounging.\nA compromise was needed, so I resolved to make a traveller that could be readily removed in harbour.\nThe Sun Fast version of the 32 has a track spanning the cockpit and several of the smaller Jeanneau yachts have a similar arrangement.\n\nWith a mainsheet bridle arrangement forward of the companionway hatch trimming is impossible from the helm. Credit: All photos Bob Goode\n\nClose inspection of these revealed that none have any real reinforcement of the cockpit sides, which in any case are quite thick GRP. However, the fittings were placed carefully so that other structures behind offered support.\nA little research soon came up with a piece on the Jeanneau owners’ website, where a New Zealand owner had used Rutgerson fittings to do exactly what I planned.\nThe Rutgerson gear even had an option of cast end plates to mount the track spanning the cockpit.\nThe only downside was the cost – nearly £300 for the castings alone.\nInstead, I opted to use Harken gear to match the boat’s existing winches and have the brackets and backing plates custom-made in stainless steel – at half the price.\nA word here on the selection of the track: most manufacturers produce ‘high beam’ versions of their track for use when spanning cockpits.\nThese are more expensive but are of a heavier section and engineered to carry the loads of an unsupported span.\nCheck with the manufacturer that the track will suit your sail area and cockpit span.\nHarken publishes this data online and in their catalogue. If in doubt a phone call or email will quickly get the facts. I found all the manufacturers helpful during the initial planning stages.\nCareful measurements were made of the cockpit sides, which are not vertical, and from these, I produced some working drawings.\nThese were given to the stainless steel fabricators, along with a short section of the track to ensure a perfect fit during manufacture.\nAs 8mm stainless steel drop nose pins would be used to hold the track in place, for simplicity I also used 8mm bolts for mounting the brackets though the GRP.\nWhen correctly fitted the drop pins would not be taking any vertical load as this would be carried by the track bearing on the upper face of the bracket.\nHowever, they would be carrying a horizontal load – hence the need for some fairly chunky ones.\nHaving selected the best location with regard to the position of the wheel, I drilled a single hole to locate the first bracket.\nI then cut the track to length and clamped it to the first bracket. I clamped the second bracket to the other end of the mainsheet track, and then took great care to not only measure the location of the second bracket but to ensure that it looked right from all angles by sighting against fixed lines such as that made by the base of the companionway.\nOnce the position was determined I drilled a hole and bolted the second bracket in place.\nNow I could remove the track and drill the remaining holes.\nAfter a final dry fit to check alignment, the plates were degreased and sealant added before I bolted them into place.\nThey were tightened lightly and then left for a couple of hours to allow the sealant to start to go off before further work. I used Nyloc nuts in the locker but, for a more pleasing finish, used dome nuts and spring washers in the aft cabin where they’d be seen.\nAfter a final tighten of the nuts I clamped the mainsheeet track back in place and drilled the holes through the track for the drop nose pins.\nI drilled from each side using the hole in the bracket as a guide, before running the drill right through to check alignment.\nI then removed the mainsheet track once more to clean up any burred edges.\nThe track ends were then secured according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the mainsheet blocks added.\nI opted for blocks by ‘Easy’ as these were half the price of the Harken equivalents.\nThe system has a double jammer on the lower block and gives the option of either a 3:1 purchase if both tails are hauled, or a 6:1 purchase if only one tail is hauled. A case of speed or ease – your choice!\nThe two ends were spliced to form a continuous loop for convenience (I did this myself as it really is a simple splice to make).\nI fitted a Lewmar snap shackle to the lower block so that it can be quickly released and taken to the guardrail before removing the track.\nThe new mainsheert track has been a big success.\nSheeting the main for better shape and control is much easier from the helm, allowing the sail to be feathered down the track, or even dumped to maintain control in gusty conditions.\nAnne likes it as the cockpit can be cleared in a matter of seconds once alongside.\nOn the downside there is a lot of rope in the cockpit – but part of the fun of a sailing boat is pulling the bits of string!\nThe skill level needed for fitting a removable mainsheet track\nThe design element relies on careful measurements with ruler, pencil and set square.\nFor the rest, it’s just drilling holes in the correct place and cutting the track square, all fairly straightforward stuff and well within the capabilities of most people.\nDo take time to make sure that the proposed location is strong enough to carry the expected loads.\nIn my case, the mid-boom sheeting on the coachroof imposes roughly twice the load of an end-boom sheeting arrangement in the cockpit.\nThis mid-boom load is taken by two relatively small eyebolts bolted through the coachroof with no particular reinforcing structure below.\nSo this, combined with my inspection of the Sun Fast 32, gave me confidence that my proposed location would be plenty strong enough.\nThe total time to fit was around five hours from start to finish and included a break for a bacon and egg bap while the sealant cured.\nInstalling a mainsheet track: Step-by-step\n\n1. The old, standard mainsheet bridle arrangement which I wanted to replace.\n\n2. The handed pair of custom-made stainless steel end fittings and their backing plates.\n\n3. Close-up of one fitting. Note the cutaway on the far side to allow easier removal of the track.\n\n4. One bolt holds the fitting in place and a clamp secures the track while the other end fitting is located. Note how masking tape stops the clamp marking the fitting.\n\n5. I used stacking boxes to support the track while the precise location was determined for the second end fitting.\n\n6. The remaining holes could then be started with the drill…\n\n7…and finished off with the track removed to make drilling access easier.\n\n8. Degrease the fittings with methylated spirits before applying sealant.\n \n\n9. Here the holes are being drilled for the drop nose pins which hold the track in place.\n\n10. Drilling the holes which are used to secure the Harken track end fittings\n\n11. The track in place complete with control lines and mainsheet system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12. The top block of the Easy mainsheet system.\n\n13. The bottom block of the Easy mainsheet system.

But which one to use?</p>\n<p>My general rule is if your vessel doesn’t have a wooden hull choose a quality two-pack system.</p>\n<p>Look at a polyurethane-based system as it doesn’t yellow like an epoxy-based paint. For wooden boat owners, I’d look at a single pack system.</p>\n<p>A good yacht enamel is traditional and hard to beat but monourethane can weld some impressive results and many wooden superyachts have switched over to this.</p>\n<p>Of course, single-pack is also something to consider if you don’t feel confident working with two-component paints and should generally be a little more budget-friendly.</p>\n<p>Whatever system you buy, make sure you buy the whole system, from primer to topcoat and fillers if they make one, as this helps to ensure everything applied to the boat is working as one and cuts out the risk of reactions.</p>\n<h3>The process</h3>\n<p>Before you even touch the yacht with sandpaper or paint, proper preparation is king.</p>\n<p>This stage is all about ensuring you have everything you need and that the work environment is going to allow you to achieve the best possible result.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93271\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93271\" class=\"wp-image-93271 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.brush_futureowns-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"The bristles of a paintbrush\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.brush_futureowns-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.brush_futureowns-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.brush_futureowns-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.brush_futureowns.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93271\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Make sure you use a wide brush</p></div>\n<p>Always buy the best of what you can afford.

Make sure you wear full PPE, including a mask and safety glasses. Credit: Kos Picture Source/Alamy</p></div>\n<p>The success of your mirror finish relies heavily on this stage, so don’t rush it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sand the surface: sanding is crucial for creating a smooth base. Start with a coarser grit, such as 120, to remove any old paint, oxidation, or surface imperfections. Gradually move to finer grits, finishing with 320- or 400-grit to create a perfectly smooth surface. Use a sanding block or a random orbit sander to maintain even pressure and avoid creating dips or waves in the surface. Make sure all your previous bigger repairs have been filled and cannot be felt by the human touch.</li>\n<li>Inspect and repair: once sanded, inspect the surface for any remaining imperfections, such as scratches, chips or dents. Fill these with a marine-grade filler or fairing compound. After the filler cures, sand it smooth, and repeat as necessary until the surface is flawless. This can really take some time – even a pin prick can show through at the end.</li>\n<li>Final cleaning: after sanding, thoroughly clean the surface again. Use a tack cloth or a lint-free rag dampened with a solvent (I like to use the top coat thinners for this, just to make sure there is no chemical contamination) to remove all sanding dust and contaminants. Ensure the surface is completely dry before moving on.</li>\n<li>Masking: mask up the hull so only the topsides can be painted, make sure you stretch the masking tape in a nice long line to achieve a sharp waterline.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Guide to achieving a mirror finish</h3>\n<p>With your preparations complete, you’re ready to begin the actual work.</p>\n<p>The process is broken down into several key stages: cleaning, inspection, sanding, cleaning, painting, compounding, polishing, and waxing.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93261\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93261\" class=\"wp-image-93261 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.roll_tip_alamy-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"A man painting a boat\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.roll_tip_alamy-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.roll_tip_alamy-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.roll_tip_alamy-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.roll_tip_alamy.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93261\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Use the roll and tip method to get the best finish possible.

Priming: setting the stage for the paint</h3>\n<p>A quality primer is essential for adhesion and building up the surface to achieve that mirror finish.</p>\n<p>The primer also helps to fill in any minor imperfections and provides a uniform base for the paint.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93258\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93258\" class=\"wp-image-93258 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.tape_futureowns-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"A person painting a boat\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.tape_futureowns-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.tape_futureowns-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.tape_futureowns-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.tape_futureowns.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93258\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Make sure the masking tape is stretched and also changed regularly throughout the process</p></div>\n<p>As suggested previously this should be a primer from the same paint system as your topcoat.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose the right primer: opt for primer compatible with your topcoat. This will provide excellent adhesion and durability.</li>\n<li>Mix and apply the primer: mix the primer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Apply with a roller, nice thin coats. I often apply three coats and then check to see if any areas require filling and work before continuing. If I’m not using an undercoat as part of a system<br />\nI apply four to five coats of primer.</li>\n<li>Guide coat: before I block sand I apply a guide coat to my hull, this allows me to see the imperfections and also helps me to make sure I’ve covered all areas when sanding.</li>\n<li>Block sanding the primer: once the primer is fully cured, it’s time to sand again. This step is where you really start to shape the surface. Use a long sanding block and wet sand with 400- to 600-grit paper. This will help to level out the primer, ensuring a perfectly smooth base for the topcoat. Don’t skip this step—it’s what separates an average finish from a professional one. If your paint system only requires the surface to be prepared with a 320- or other grit sandpaper you can now run back over the hull in the same movement with the correct grade to create the appropriate surface key.</li>\n<li>Final wipe down: after sanding, wipe down the surface with a tack cloth and a degreaser to remove any dust or residue. The surface should now be flawless, with no visible imperfections.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Undercoat: if required (not for every system)</h3>\n<p>Not all systems require undercoat but if they do follow the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>\n<p>Apply the coats as evenly as you can and then sand them back in the same manner as the primer.</p>\n<h3>3. Painting: applying topcoat</h3>\n<p>This is where the magic happens. Topcoat is the key to achieving that deep, reflective finish.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93257\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93257\" class=\"wp-image-93257 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.technique_futureown-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"Two men applying blue paint to a boat\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.technique_futureown-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.technique_futureown-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.technique_futureown-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_mirror_finish.technique_futureown.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93257\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">On large areas, the best method is for one person to roll the paint on with a gloss paint roller, and the other to follow with a brush for tipping off. Credit: David Harding/Future</p></div>\n<p>Here’s how to do it right.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fresh tape: change the masking tape; it sounds daft but your masking tape has just witnessed primer, undercoat and sanding dust, so it’s time to change it and remove all that dust and grime.</li>\n<li>Mixing paint: follow the manufacturer’s instructions precisely when mixing. Two-pack ratios must be exact to ensure proper curing and maximum durability. Once mixed, let the paint sit for a few minutes to allow any air bubbles to rise to the surface. Your thinners ratio wants to be spot on for the maximum allowance of thinners for the product; you may have to adjust this based on the ambient temperature.</li>\n<li>Strain the paint: strain the paint into a fresh cup to remove any impurities or particles that could mar the finish. This step is crucial for achieving a smooth, glass-like finish.</li>\n<li>Apply paint: apply the paint using the tip and roll technique. To tip and roll paint, first use a roller to apply the paint evenly, then use a brush to lightly ‘tip’ over the wet paint, smoothing out roller marks for a smooth finish. Depending on the surface, I like to go vertically with both and run onto the masking tape edges. When tipping and rolling paint, overlap each stroke by about 50% to ensure even coverage and blend the edges seamlessly.</li>\n<li>Inspect between coats: after each coat, inspect the surface for any imperfections such as runs, sags, or dust nibs. If necessary, lightly wet sand with 1,000 to 1,500-grit paper to correct these issues before applying the next coat. Wipe down the surface after sanding and never sand wet paint.</li>\n<li>Final coat: I normally aim to do three coats in entirety, but the final coat is the most important. It should be applied with precision and care. This coat is where the depth and clarity of the finish will truly shine through. Make sure the environment is as clean as possible to avoid any contaminants from settling on the wet paint.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4.

Patience is key here – don’t rush this process.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tape: get the masking tape off as soon as you can; this allows any trapped paint to dry and the tape to come off easily.</li>\n<li>Initial drying: allow the final coat to dry in a dust-free environment.

Credit: Gary Blake/Alamy</p></div>\n<p>This will help you achieve that perfect mirror finish and give you a surface to care for beyond the paint. It will also need to be polished.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clear coat: add one or two clear coats to the hull, following the manufacturer’s instructions.</li>\n<li>Wet sanding: start with 1,500-grit sandpaper to remove any orange peel, dust nibs, or minor imperfections from the surface. Progressively move to finer grits, such as 2,000 and then 3,000, until the surface is uniformly smooth. Use a sanding block to maintain an even surface and avoid creating dips, and use plenty of water. Check the clear coat tin for instructions on what grit to use.</li>\n<li>Buffing: after sanding the surface will look dull, but that’s about to change. Using a variable-speed polisher with<br />\na foam or wool pad apply a cutting compound. Start at a low speed, gradually increasing as you work the compound into the surface. The goal is to remove the sanding marks and bring out the gloss.</li>\n<li>Final polishing: once the cutting compound has done its job, switch to a finer polishing compound. This will refine the gloss and remove any swirl marks left by the buffing process. Finish with a swirl remover or glaze to achieve that deep, wet-look shine.</li>\n<li>Cleaning up: after polishing, clean the surface with a microfibre cloth to remove any residue. Inspect the finish in natural light to ensure there are no missed spots or imperfections. The surface should now be flawless, reflecting like a mirror.</li>\n<li>Apply a wax or sealant: once the polish is complete, apply a high-quality marine wax or sealant to protect the paint from UV rays, salt, and environmental contaminants. Use a soft applicator pad and apply in small sections, then buff to a high shine with a microfibre cloth.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>6.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Lyndon March explains how to get the perfect mirror finish on your wooden or GRP hull\nA mirror finish is all about careful preparation and paint selection.

It’s also about protection and ease of maintenance.\nA well-finished yacht resists the elements, ensuring that it looks as good in a decade as it does today, reduces prep for year-on-year re-coating and could even add value to your vessel.\nHere’s a step-by-step guide for those thinking of refinishing a tired gelcoat with paint or simply achieving that mirror finish on their classic.\nWe also look at keeping it singing for seasons to come, all achieved with a brush.\nBefore diving into the nitty-gritty of how to achieve a mirror finish, it’s important to understand what exactly I mean by this.\n\nOver time, the surface of the boat will degrade due to wear and tear, saltwater or UV rays. Credit: Graham Snook\n\nA good paint job is a good paint job, but a mirror finish refers to a surface so smooth and reflective that it resembles a mirror.\nThis is achieved when the outermost layer of paint on the boat reflects light in a completely uniform way, with no visible imperfections, dull spots, or oxidation.\nYour paint, or for some of us the old gelcoat, is the first line of defence against the harsh marine environment, and it’s also what reflects the yacht’s overall condition.\nOver time, exposure to saltwater, UV rays, and general wear and tear can cause this layer to degrade.\nThe shine fades, and the surface becomes dull, chalky, or even rough to the touch.\nA proper mirror finish restores the surface to its original glory, or in many cases, takes it to a level never previously achieved.\nBefore looking at the process to achieve a mirror finish, it is important to consider your choice of marine paint.\nThe paint you select not only affects the final appearance but also the durability and maintenance of the finish.\nMarine paints are formulated to withstand the harsh conditions at sea, including UV exposure, saltwater, and varying temperatures.\nHowever, there are a few variables the boat owner needs to consider such as hull material, environment and cost.\nWhich type of marine paint is best for a mirror finish?\n\nA polyurethane-based system will not yellow over time when applied to a GRP hull. Credit: Richard Hare\n\nThere are many different types of marine paint available but single-component (single-pack) and two-component (two-pack) systems are the most commonly used for top-coating yachts.\nThe second gives the ultimate hard-wearing finish with lasting shine; the first provides something close in finish but generally doesn’t last as long. But which one to use?\nMy general rule is if your vessel doesn’t have a wooden hull choose a quality two-pack system.\nLook at a polyurethane-based system as it doesn’t yellow like an epoxy-based paint. For wooden boat owners, I’d look at a single pack system.\nA good yacht enamel is traditional and hard to beat but monourethane can weld some impressive results and many wooden superyachts have switched over to this.\nOf course, single-pack is also something to consider if you don’t feel confident working with two-component paints and should generally be a little more budget-friendly.\nWhatever system you buy, make sure you buy the whole system, from primer to topcoat and fillers if they make one, as this helps to ensure everything applied to the boat is working as one and cuts out the risk of reactions.\nThe process\nBefore you even touch the yacht with sandpaper or paint, proper preparation is king.\nThis stage is all about ensuring you have everything you need and that the work environment is going to allow you to achieve the best possible result.\n\nMake sure you use a wide brush\n\nAlways buy the best of what you can afford. Cheap sandpaper is a false economy, for example, and not having all the kit can get you in a real muddle.\nCleaning supplies: marine-grade soap, decontamination solutions, buckets, sponges, and microfibre cloths.\nMasking tape: look for something low tack – it removes more easily.\nBrushes and rollers: a nice wide brush that won’t shed bristles and roller heads that won’t dissolve in your paint. I like a foam roller.\nSandpaper: various grits ranging from 800 to 3,000-grit, depending on the condition of the surface. Remember to invest in quality paper\nFiller: pick something appropriate that works with your type of craft and the paint system you’re using.\nOrbital sander: you don’t need the most flash sander, but you do need dust extraction. For a long time, I had a basic Screwfix sander attached to a Henry vacuum cleaner.\nGuide coat: there are lots of options to choose from. Personally, I prefer a dry coat I can shake and rub on but the spray ones available in a can are just as effective.\nSafety gear: gloves, safety glasses, and a respirator for working with chemicals and dust.\nEnvironment\nThe environment in which you work can significantly impact the outcome.\nIdeally, you should work in a controlled environment indoors or under a canopy where you can avoid direct sunlight, dust, and debris.\nHigh humidity or extreme temperatures can affect how products cure or dry, so aim for mild, stable conditions.\n\nIt’s best to paint your boat indoors in a controlled environment as humidity and temperature will affect how the paint dries and cures. Credit: Graham Snook/Future\n\nHowever, the ideal environment isn’t always available and this can all be done outside.\nMake sure you pick nice, dry, cloudy days, in which the weather isn’t too extreme.\nYou can always create shade with a large tarp hanging over the vessel pegged out to the sides, or create wind barriers by creating a polythene tent to keep the wind out.\nIt’s also important to think about the working height of the boat. If you can, build a platform or staging to work on that allows you to walk easily and quickly around the hull.\nIf you can’t, a scaffolding tower on wheels or even a hop-up are great options but just add time to the process through constant repositioning.\nHave a plan to achieve a perfect mirror finish\nRushing through the process is a recipe for disaster. Depending on the size of your boat and the condition of the surface, achieving a mirror finish can take anywhere from a couple of days to over a week.\nPlan your time accordingly, ensuring you have enough daylight and good weather conditions to complete each stage without interruptions.\nIt’s okay to not get everything done on the same day or even the same weekend. Just make sure that any paint has always had a keying coat if you miss an overcoat window, and that the surface is protected from damage between work days.\nThorough cleaning\nThe first step is to give your yacht a thorough clean. This might seem like a simple task, but it’s critical to remove every bit of dirt, grime, and residue from the surface.\n\nMake sure you thoroughly clean your boat before you start. Credit: Cor Laffra/Alamy\n\nAny contaminants left on the surface can interfere with the sanding and in some cases affect the final finish.\nUse marine-grade soap and water to wash the entire surface of the boat. Be thorough, making sure to reach all the nooks and crannies.\nAs an alternative, sugar soap also works well.\nInspect the surface\nOnce the yacht is clean, it’s time to inspect the surface for damage.\n\nCheck the surface of the gelcoat for cracks and chips and repair with a good quality filler. Credit: Ben Meakins\n\nThis step involves a detailed examination of the surface to identify any areas that need repair.\nCheck for cracks and chips: carefully examine the surface for any cracks, chips, or blisters. These imperfections need to be addressed before moving on to the next steps. In most cases, a good quality filler should fix all concerns but if you are worried or the area requires major repairs consult a boat builder.\nRepair as needed: use a gelcoat repair kit or filler to fix any damage. After applying the repair material, sand it smooth with 320- to 400-grit sandpaper to blend it into the surrounding area. It’s important that as you run your hand over this area you can’t feel an edge between the repair and the hull.\nPreparation: the foundation of a flawless finish\nBefore you even think about opening that can of two-pack paint, the surface preparation must be impeccable.\n\nBegin sanding with coarser grit before gradually moving to a finer grit. Make sure you wear full PPE, including a mask and safety glasses. Credit: Kos Picture Source/Alamy\n\nThe success of your mirror finish relies heavily on this stage, so don’t rush it.\nSand the surface: sanding is crucial for creating a smooth base. Start with a coarser grit, such as 120, to remove any old paint, oxidation, or surface imperfections. Gradually move to finer grits, finishing with 320- or 400-grit to create a perfectly smooth surface. Use a sanding block or a random orbit sander to maintain even pressure and avoid creating dips or waves in the surface. Make sure all your previous bigger repairs have been filled and cannot be felt by the human touch.\nInspect and repair: once sanded, inspect the surface for any remaining imperfections, such as scratches, chips or dents. Fill these with a marine-grade filler or fairing compound. After the filler cures, sand it smooth, and repeat as necessary until the surface is flawless. This can really take some time – even a pin prick can show through at the end.\nFinal cleaning: after sanding, thoroughly clean the surface again. Use a tack cloth or a lint-free rag dampened with a solvent (I like to use the top coat thinners for this, just to make sure there is no chemical contamination) to remove all sanding dust and contaminants. Ensure the surface is completely dry before moving on.\nMasking: mask up the hull so only the topsides can be painted, make sure you stretch the masking tape in a nice long line to achieve a sharp waterline.\nGuide to achieving a mirror finish\nWith your preparations complete, you’re ready to begin the actual work.\nThe process is broken down into several key stages: cleaning, inspection, sanding, cleaning, painting, compounding, polishing, and waxing.\n\nUse the roll and tip method to get the best finish possible. Credit: Michele Cornelius/Alamy\n\nEach step builds on the previous one, so it’s important to follow them in order.\n1. Priming: setting the stage for the paint\nA quality primer is essential for adhesion and building up the surface to achieve that mirror finish.\nThe primer also helps to fill in any minor imperfections and provides a uniform base for the paint.\n\nMake sure the masking tape is stretched and also changed regularly throughout the process\n\nAs suggested previously this should be a primer from the same paint system as your topcoat.\nChoose the right primer: opt for primer compatible with your topcoat. This will provide excellent adhesion and durability.\nMix and apply the primer: mix the primer according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Apply with a roller, nice thin coats. I often apply three coats and then check to see if any areas require filling and work before continuing. If I’m not using an undercoat as part of a system\nGuide coat: before I block sand I apply a guide coat to my hull, this allows me to see the imperfections and also helps me to make sure I’ve covered all areas when sanding.\nBlock sanding the primer: once the primer is fully cured, it’s time to sand again. This step is where you really start to shape the surface. Use a long sanding block and wet sand with 400- to 600-grit paper. This will help to level out the primer, ensuring a perfectly smooth base for the topcoat. Don’t skip this step—it’s what separates an average finish from a professional one. If your paint system only requires the surface to be prepared with a 320- or other grit sandpaper you can now run back over the hull in the same movement with the correct grade to create the appropriate surface key.\nFinal wipe down: after sanding, wipe down the surface with a tack cloth and a degreaser to remove any dust or residue. The surface should now be flawless, with no visible imperfections.\n2. Undercoat: if required (not for every system)\nNot all systems require undercoat but if they do follow the manufacturer’s instructions.\nApply the coats as evenly as you can and then sand them back in the same manner as the primer.\n3. Painting: applying topcoat\nThis is where the magic happens. Topcoat is the key to achieving that deep, reflective finish.\n\nOn large areas, the best method is for one person to roll the paint on with a gloss paint roller, and the other to follow with a brush for tipping off. Credit: David Harding/Future\n\nHere’s how to do it right.\nFresh tape: change the masking tape; it sounds daft but your masking tape has just witnessed primer, undercoat and sanding dust, so it’s time to change it and remove all that dust and grime.\nMixing paint: follow the manufacturer’s instructions precisely when mixing. Two-pack ratios must be exact to ensure proper curing and maximum durability. Once mixed, let the paint sit for a few minutes to allow any air bubbles to rise to the surface. Your thinners ratio wants to be spot on for the maximum allowance of thinners for the product; you may have to adjust this based on the ambient temperature.\nStrain the paint: strain the paint into a fresh cup to remove any impurities or particles that could mar the finish. This step is crucial for achieving a smooth, glass-like finish.\nApply paint: apply the paint using the tip and roll technique. To tip and roll paint, first use a roller to apply the paint evenly, then use a brush to lightly ‘tip’ over the wet paint, smoothing out roller marks for a smooth finish. Depending on the surface, I like to go vertically with both and run onto the masking tape edges. When tipping and rolling paint, overlap each stroke by about 50% to ensure even coverage and blend the edges seamlessly.\nInspect between coats: after each coat, inspect the surface for any imperfections such as runs, sags, or dust nibs. If necessary, lightly wet sand with 1,000 to 1,500-grit paper to correct these issues before applying the next coat. Wipe down the surface after sanding and never sand wet paint.\nFinal coat: I normally aim to do three coats in entirety, but the final coat is the most important. It should be applied with precision and care. This coat is where the depth and clarity of the finish will truly shine through. Make sure the environment is as clean as possible to avoid any contaminants from settling on the wet paint.\n4. Curing: letting the paint set\n\nMake sure you check for runs, sags or dust nibs between each coat of paint. Credit: SeventyFourImages/Alamy\n\nPaint requires proper curing time to reach its full hardness and gloss. Patience is key here – don’t rush this process.\nTape: get the masking tape off as soon as you can; this allows any trapped paint to dry and the tape to come off easily.\nInitial drying: allow the final coat to dry in a dust-free environment. This can take anywhere from a few hours to overnight, depending on temperature, humidity, and product.\nFull cure: full curing typically takes 7-10 days. During this time, avoid touching or placing anything on the painted surface. This curing period allows the paint to fully harden, which is crucial for the next step – polishing.\n5. Extra Mirror: clear coats and polishing\n\nYou can add several coats of clear coat if you have a spray gun. Make sure you wear protective gear. Credit: SeventyFourImages/Alamy\n\nIf you have a spray gun you can use it to give a real shine.\nBefore the paint has fully cured, the surface will likely have a high gloss; a spray gun can be used to add one or two coats of clear coat.\n\nStart polishing at a low speed to work in the compound. Credit: Gary Blake/Alamy\n\nThis will help you achieve that perfect mirror finish and give you a surface to care for beyond the paint. It will also need to be polished.\nClear coat: add one or two clear coats to the hull, following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nWet sanding: start with 1,500-grit sandpaper to remove any orange peel, dust nibs, or minor imperfections from the surface. Progressively move to finer grits, such as 2,000 and then 3,000, until the surface is uniformly smooth. Use a sanding block to maintain an even surface and avoid creating dips, and use plenty of water. Check the clear coat tin for instructions on what grit to use.\nBuffing: after sanding the surface will look dull, but that’s about to change. Using a variable-speed polisher with\nFinal polishing: once the cutting compound has done its job, switch to a finer polishing compound. This will refine the gloss and remove any swirl marks left by the buffing process. Finish with a swirl remover or glaze to achieve that deep, wet-look shine.\nCleaning up: after polishing, clean the surface with a microfibre cloth to remove any residue. Inspect the finish in natural light to ensure there are no missed spots or imperfections. The surface should now be flawless, reflecting like a mirror.\nApply a wax or sealant: once the polish is complete, apply a high-quality marine wax or sealant to protect the paint from UV rays, salt, and environmental contaminants. Use a soft applicator pad and apply in small sections, then buff to a high shine with a microfibre cloth.\n6. Sealing and Protecting: ensuring longevity\n\nMake sure you reapply wax or sealant every few months or as necessary to maintain the hull finish. Credit: Patrick Eden/Alamy\n\nAfter all that hard work, you want to protect your finish to keep it looking pristine for as long as possible.\nRegular maintenance: clean the yacht regularly with mild, pH-balanced soap and water. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that could dull the finish. Reapply wax or sealant every few months, depending on usage and exposure to the elements.\nWaterline: keep the waterline clean so you don’t damage the paint layers.\nRepair: for any places where the paint chaffs or gets knocked, spend the time to repair that area.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nPainting and varnishing a boat: how to get the perfect finish\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nKit boat builder Polly Robinson shares her tips for painting and varnishing a plywood-epoxy boat\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSurface preparation for polishing or varnishing a boat\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMirka’s Andy Mierau shares trade tips on how to prepare surfaces for polishing or varnishing\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBest boat varnish: 7 top options for gleaming woodwork\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFew things are as quintessential to the archetypal sailboat as gleaming, iridescent woodwork that is indicative of a recent coat…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBoat wood: a complete guide for yacht owners\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBoatbuilder and finisher Lyndon March explains which types of wood work best for different repairs and modifications on board\nWant to read more practical articles?\n\nA subscription to Practical Boat Owner magazine costs around 40% less than the cover price.\nPrint and digital editions are available through Magazines Direct – where you can also find the latest deals.\nPBO is packed with information to help you get the most from boat ownership – whether sail or power.\nTake your DIY skills to the next level with trusted advice on boat maintenance and repairs\nImpartial in-depth gear reviews\nPractical cruising tips for making the most of your time afloat\nFollow us on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter",

If it fails to budge then more drastic measures are needed.</p>\n<p>Heat from a gas gun can be used and if that fails, the final measure is to get a hacksaw on the bearing.</p>\n<p>Take the blade out of the hacksaw, feed it through the bearing and fit it back into the frame.</p>\n<p>The idea is that you carefully cut a thin slit along the length of the bearing.</p>\n<p>Exercise extreme caution to prevent damage to the surrounding P-bracket housing.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_93241\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-93241\" class=\"wp-image-93241 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_engine_bearing.cleaning_comm-630x355.jpg\" alt=\"A clean shaft on a boat ready for cutless bearing replacement\" width=\"630\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_engine_bearing.cleaning_comm-630x355.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_engine_bearing.cleaning_comm-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_engine_bearing.cleaning_comm-768x433.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2025/02/edPBO310.prac_engine_bearing.cleaning_comm.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-93241\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The propeller shaft is cleaned and ready for the new bearing.

Stu uses a three-legged puller (in place); note the loose nut in place to prevent the prop from dropping off the shaft. Credit: Stu Davies\nBefore I dive into this article on cutless bearing replacement, a few words on how it got its name wouldn’t go amiss.\nIt is a cutless bearing, not cutlass!\nCutless bearings are used to support propeller shafts and were originally called stave bearings; think wooden barrel staves fitted longitudinally in a propeller shaft housing to act as a support and bearing for the shaft.\nThey used to be made of a very hard tropical wood known as lignum vitae, latterly Tufnol was used.\nOriginally, Cutless was a trademark owned by Duramax Marine. The name refers to a moulded rubber bearing manufactured by them and hence cutless became a generic name.\n\nA cutless bearing can last for 10 years or more; if there is excessive vibration or play under way it must be changed as soon as possible to prevent shaft damage. Credit: Stu Davies\n\nAnother explanation of the origin of the name is from their manufacture; originally the bearings were made of cut pieces of material staved together, however, the ones we use nowadays are moulded or machined from solid pieces of material and are therefore cutless.\nBeneteau and other modern yachts use a grooved top hat-shaped moulded rubber bearing.\nOthers use a brass/bronze bush with either rubber or Tufnol as the bearing material.\nThey all have one thing in common: longitudinal grooves which allow water to lube the entire bearing.\nThey are submerged and lubricated by copious amounts of water.\nMany years ago as an apprentice, I learned that water is an excellent lubricant as long as there is enough of it.\nThe cutless bearing plays a crucial role in your boat’s smooth operation. This bearing supports the propeller shaft and minimises friction and vibration as it rotates.\nThe bearing either fits in a propeller shaft moulding inside the hull itself, like my Beneteau, or in a P-bracket hung from the hull.\nSymptoms of a failing cutlass bearing include excessive vibration while underway. Usually, a deep rumbling can be felt and heard through the hull.\nWorn-out cutless bearings can also lead to shaft damage so early intervention is important.\nCarrying out a cutless bearing replacement is a relatively easy job for most boat owners with some mechanical knowledge.\nBrave people can replace the bearings like mine in the water BUT it is best – especially if yours is a P-bracket type – to do it on the hard because the prop shaft will probably have to be removed to gain proper access.\nEnsure your new cutless bearing matches the exact size and specifications of your existing one.\nOlder boats use imperial sizes and sometimes a mixture of metric and imperial, so measure carefully.\nCutless bearing replacement: removing the old bearing\nRemoving the old cutless bearing is relatively easy on boats such as mine, but a bit more is involved in P-bracket type bearings.\nRemoving the propeller will be necessary in both types of bearing replacement.\n\nThe tab washer and securing nut. Credit: Stu Davies\n\nFirst, remove the nut securing the propeller to the shaft. This will probably entail a split pin or tabbed lock washer which locks the securing nut on.\nI use a piece of timber jammed into the prop blades and held against the hull to stop the prop from turning while loosening the nut.\nIt is normally right-handed so ‘lefty loosey’ applies.\nCarefully detach the propeller by using a beefy three-legged puller if you have a three-blade prop, or a two-legged puller on a two-blade prop.\n TOP TIP: Be careful here. Leave the nut partially on to catch the prop when the taper fit is released. The prop on my boat has three blades and is usually quite well fitted so a heavy whack with a hammer on the puller thread head is needed, but it makes it come off suddenly! You don’t want that dropping on your foot.\nThere is also usually a feather key in the prop as part of the securing mechanism; don’t let it fall off into the oggin.\nSome cutless bearings have set screws in the bearing housing to prevent them from turning. Locate and remove these screws.\n\nThe old bearing; note the scoring yet the shaft is OK. Credit: Stu Davies\n\nNow comes the tricky bit. My type of bearing is rubber and usually slides out by hand before I easily push the new one back in.\nI like to put silicone grease on the shaft and the new bearing.\nThis sounds very easy unless you have experienced prop entanglement, as I did two months ago in Portugal.\nUnfortunately, the line wrapped around the prop shaft rope cutter, the prop shaft itself and cutless bearing housing.\nThis forced the soft rubber cutless bearing flange up into the prop shaft cutless bearing housing, wedging it in.\n\nThe prop rope cutter on Stu’s boat. Credit: Stu Davies\n\nCutless bearing replacement: P-bracket bearing removal\nThe easiest way to remove the bearing from a P-bracket is to remove the prop shaft.\nThis involves removing the gearbox flange off the tapered (usually!) propeller shaft and removing the propeller as above.\nThe shaft can then be slid out; usually, there is enough room for it to slide past the rudder but if it doesn’t then you’ll also need to remove the rudder.\nRemoving and replacing the bearing with the shaft out\nInitially, I try removing the bearing with a hammer and dolly, a round object which fits the outer diameter of the bearing.\nMake sure someone is on the opposite side of the P-bracket holding another hammer or heavy object to avoid shocking the P-bracket too much.\nIf that fails to loosen the bearing, you will need to make and use a bearing puller.\n\nThe old bearing after it was forced up the prop shaft housing. Screws and careful leverage were required. Credit: Stu Davies\n\nFor this, you’ll need a long threaded rod, 10mm or larger; it needs to be long enough to go through the cutless bearing with some rod left over.\nTwo tube spacers, one a touch bigger than the outer diameter of the bearing, and one a touch smaller than the inside diameter of the bearing are also needed.\nPut the threaded rod through the bearing with the outer diameter spacer at one end and the internal diameter spacer at the other.\nPut some heavy gauge washers on each end and the 10mm nuts.\nThe idea is that as you tighten the nuts the smaller spacer pushes against the bearing and it slides out through the bigger spacer.\nNote that some considerable force may be needed. If it fails to budge then more drastic measures are needed.\nHeat from a gas gun can be used and if that fails, the final measure is to get a hacksaw on the bearing.\nTake the blade out of the hacksaw, feed it through the bearing and fit it back into the frame.\nThe idea is that you carefully cut a thin slit along the length of the bearing.\nExercise extreme caution to prevent damage to the surrounding P-bracket housing.\n\nThe propeller shaft is cleaned and ready for the new bearing. Credit: Stu Davies\n\nOnce split, use a chisel and hammer to break the bearing apart and remove the pieces.\nThoroughly inspect and clean the propeller shaft with sandpaper or a wire brush.\nClean the bearing housing as well, removing any remnants of the old bearing and ensuring a smooth surface for the new one.\nCutless bearing replacement: Leaving the prop shaft in place\nTo get the bearing out without removing the propeller shaft you’ll need to make U-shaped bearing pushers.\nThis is a piece of tube with the same internal diameter as the shaft’s outer diameter, cut in two longitudinally.\nLoosely clamp it to the shaft with a hose clamp so that it butts up against the end of the bearing; this allows pressure to be applied to the bearing to push or pull it out.\nTwo threaded rods are also needed along with a U-shaped plate and a straight plate.\n\nNew bearing location screw holes. Credit: Stu Davies\n\nDrill holes in them to allow the threaded rod to go outside of the P-bracket.\nWhen tightening, the threaded rod will pull the U-shaped plate against the U-shaped bearing pushers to push the bearing out.\nThe problem with this method is that if the bearing is too tight and won’t come out easily, the hacksaw method to split the bearing cannot be used.\nInstalling a new bearing\nI like to use silicone grease to lubricate everything. Apply a thin layer of silicone grease to the clean propeller shaft and the bearing.\nFirst, you need to prepare the new bearing. Some bearings may require a slight chamfer (bevelled edge) on the leading edge to help with insertion.\n\nThe new bearing and securing screws in place. Credit: Stu Davies\n\nCarefully slide the new bearing onto the shaft, or into the P-bracket housing and tap or use the puller/pusher to push it into place.\nSome people like to epoxy the bearing into place; I don’t like that idea unless it’s very loose.\nOnce the bearing is positioned correctly, tighten any set screws to secure it in place. Then refit the propeller back onto the shaft.\nI like to slide the prop on first without any key in place and mark where it goes along the shaft.\n\nMake sure you mark where the key goes along the shaft before fitting it. Credit: Stu Davies\n\nThen I fit the key and push the prop on ensuring it reaches the mark. This proves that the prop isn’t riding on top of the key.\nThe taper provides the drive force connection between the shaft and the prop and not the key.\nIf it ‘rides’ the key, the taper will not grip properly.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBoat propeller: How to choose the right one for your boat\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe correct prop can have a dramatic effect on your boat's performance.

Credit: Paul Diamond\nI had a hole in my 15-year-old Excel SD230 inflatable tender, and the first stumbling block to carrying out a dinghy repair was removing the valves to enable an inside patch to be applied, writes Paul Diamond.\nTo do a permanent and durable repair, it is better to first patch from the inside and then put a cover patch on the outside once the tubes are inflated.\nA polythene bag can be placed behind the patch to prevent the tubes from being glued together when pressing and rollering the inside patch on.\n\nA 12-sided socket was easier to modify than a six-sided one. Credit: Paul Diamond\n\nI tied a string to the bag so I could pull it back out through the valve hole once completed.\nHowever, the plastic valve wrench bought specifically for this job snapped when I attempted to unscrew the valves from their seats.\nI guess years of saltwater use had bound the valves to their holes.\nThe solution was to find a socket that fitted, in my case a 24mm one with 12 sides.\nUsing an angle grinder and a thin metal cutting disc, I cut six slots into the socket to align with the valve splines.\n\nModified 24mm socket spanner was just the right size. Credit: Paul Diamond\n\nOnce the slots were cut the socket almost fitted, but was just slightly too narrow to fit over the valve internals.\nSo I ground out the internal edges with a Dremmel stone tool mounted in my pillar drill, and the socket securely held in a vice.\nThis took a bit of fettling to get just right, as I didn’t want to remove more material than necessary.\nIt would have been difficult to do this successfully with a hexagonal six-sided socket.\n\nSocket in use with a drive handle on the valve. Credit: Paul Diamond\n\nI was then able to use a normal socket driver to apply the pressure needed to loosen the valve.\nI found by holding the back of the valve and applying continuous pressure with the socket driver, I soon had the valve unscrewing.\nI used garden wire to tie the valve backs near their holes, to save having to fish for them later once the repair was completed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nInflatable boat valve replacement: step by step\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA failed inner valve could spell the end of an inflatable tender – but Jake Frith has a fix\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBoat towing and berthing by tender\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIf your engine fails to start, being able to berth your boat using the tender is an extremely useful skill,…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBest inflatable boat: 9 compact tenders put to the test\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nInflatables are everywhere: paddleboards, canoes, kayaks, tents, kites and wings – and inflatable boat technology has long been a practical…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nChoosing a boat dinghy – top tips for buying and maintaining tenders\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFrom getting on and off the yacht to collecting supplies, visiting friends or simply going fishing, tenders play an important…\nWant to read more practical articles like How I made a specialist tool to repair my dinghy?\n\nA subscription to Practical Boat Owner magazine costs around 40% less than the cover price.\nPrint and digital editions are available through Magazines Direct – where you can also find the latest deals.\nPBO is packed with information to help you get the most from boat ownership – whether sail or power.\nTake your DIY skills to the next level with trusted advice on boat maintenance and repairs\nImpartial in-depth gear reviews\nPractical cruising tips for making the most of your time afloat\nFollow us on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter",

Ali Wood gets top tips from the liveaboard Stevens family\nStef and Rich Stevens crossed the Atlantic with their two-year-old and seven-month-old sons. Credit: Stevens Family\n“Crossing the Atlantic with these two is not something I would recommend,” says Stef Stevens, mother of seven-month-old Roux and two-year-old Jesse. “But I have no regrets about sailing with family either.”\nWhen Stef and her husband Rich set sail from Jersey to Grenada they knew it was going to be hard, but as Stef puts it, life would be busy anyway, so “why not chuck in a couple of night watches and see a bit more of the world?”\nThe first challenge was selecting the right boat. They already owned a family share in a Beneteau Oceanis 423.\nWhile Rich and Stef loved sailing the yacht, their business – a RIB tour company operating in France and the Channel Islands – meant they only managed 10 days a year aboard.\nWanting to sail in the winter, they tried charter holidays in the Caribbean, Whitsundays and BVI.\nEleven years into the RIB business, and with two young children, the couple felt it was time to sell up and ‘make the most of the winters’.\n\nPinnacle is a Nautitech 46 Open catamaran. Credit: Stevens Family\n\nThey considered keeping a boat abroad but didn’t like the idea of leaving it every year, so instead decided to buy one and sail it around the world.\nThe Beneteau wasn’t an option for that, so their share was sold back to the family.\nFor Stef, who knew she’d be spending a lot of time in the cabin with Roux and Jesse, a catamaran was the only option.\n“I’m not the sailor, Rich is, but when we decided to do this as a family, the multihull was non-negotiable!”\nThey bought Pinnacle, a Nautitech 46 Open, and in November 2024 set sail for the Caribbean on the ARC+, the sister event to the Atlantic Rally for Cruisers, which has a stopover in Cape Verde.\nOn board with them was Stef’s father David and Rich’s brother Jonty.\n\nAlways with a lifejacket, children are also clipped on to an adult when on deck. Credit: Stevens Family\n\nThe first leg – to Mindelo, Cape Verde – was the roughest, with Roux spending a lot of time in his carrier and Jesse in a soft cordoned-off area in the saloon.\n“A boat, even a catamaran, is a small space for children when you compare it to a house on land,” says Stef.\n“You don’t have gardens and parks, so you have to find ways to entertain them; for example, constantly rotating toys to keep them away from screen time.”\nDespite it being ‘a bit rocky and rolly,’ none of the family suffered from sea sickness, and the second leg, to Port Louis in Grenada, was much calmer.\nThere were even a few days mid-Atlantic when they put a ball pit and a paddling pool on the bow.\n“They both had little baths in a saltwater pool. It felt very luxurious,” says Stef.\n\nJesse was aged two and Roux just seven months when the Stevens family set sail. Credit: World Cruising Club\n\nThe kids reached key milestones during the passage.\nIn Gran Canaria Roux was commando crawling on his belly, and by the time they reached Grenada, he was pulling himself up onto the furniture. Meanwhile, Jesse cut his first two teeth and learned to use the potty.\n“He got a huge round of applause – everyone was there to watch!” says Stef. “We gave him stickers and cookies too, which really tested my provisioning!”\nStef has bought reusable nappies for Roux, but isn’t ready to take on the additional workload of washing them until Jesse is dry at night.\n“We’re down to two a day now, so getting there,” she says.\nBeing skipper, Rich was needed a lot on deck, so Stef took charge of the children, as well as the cooking and cleaning.\n\nJigsaw play mater is soft underfoot. Credit: Ali Wood\n\nShe spent much of the time indoors, particularly as she was breastfeeding, but was grateful for the panoramic view of the ocean, which you don’t always get on a monohull.\nIt also meant she could nip outside and help with sail changes, while still keeping an eye on the children through the glass doors.\nThe layout was a benefit for Rich too. “It’s all open, everyone’s in one place and the helm is on the same level so it’s not like having a flybridge where I’d be up there and out the picture,” he says.\n“If we were on a monohull and Stef and the kids were stuck down below it would have been a lot harder I think.”\nThey managed the watch schedule so that Rich would be free from 6pm till 8pm so he could help with dinner at bath time.\n“At home, I’d always put Jesse to bed so it was nice to keep up that routine, but sometimes I’d be suddenly busy and couldn’t help.”\n\nGuest berth doubles as a play room and can be zipped shut. Credit: Ali Wood\n\nStef took the 11pm to 2am watch. “That was my choice, I liked sailing into the night and then handing over to Dad and Jonty.”\nAnother advantage of a catamaran is there’s a lot less motion. Stef points out that Roux wouldn’t have been able to stand or Jesse run around if the boat was rolling.\nThe couple removed the door between their cabin and the small ‘office space’ that they converted into the nursery.\n“Knowing the kids were in eyesight in the cabin space was reassuring,” says Stef. “You do feel vulnerable and scared for their safety even in the calmest of conditions, but they are children and you’d be the same on land crossing a road!”\n“It definitely wasn’t easy,” adds Rich. “These guys like to pull everything, and they had to be barricaded around the boat. But they still had a good space to run and crawl around in.”\n\nA catamaran offered space that would be hard to match in a monohull. Credit: Ali Wood\n\nThey also bought a subscription to offshore medical support, which provides full paediatric care and antibiotics.\n“It’s really substantial, though quite expensive,” says Rich. “We only used it a couple of times and both of them were actually on land. Very minor things, like when Jesse cut his head while in a supermarket, but you’re paying for that service so any doubt and you can use it, which is a great reassurance.\n“Being a part of the ARC was such a comfort, ticking off all the safety things that you need when you’re travelling with young children.”\nOn deck, Jesse was either clipped to the boat or wearing a lifejacket. Roux was strapped to Stef all the time, or being held, so he didn’t wear a lifejacket.\nStef was grateful to have her dad and Jonty with her, who were always on hand to read to Jesse.\n\nA wooden train set gives hours of fun. Credit: Stevens Family\n\n“He loves books – we have a whole library on board, and the Duplo train set was a hit, too.”\n“They loved it,” says Rich. “Now and again when we got close to another boat Jesse would be like, ‘big boat!’ and there would be lots of smiles. We saw a few dolphins, which is always exciting, and shooting stars, sunrises, sunsets – all of the things you want kids to be excited about.”\nAmazingly, sleep – a big challenge for any new parent – wasn’t a problem onboard Pinnacle.\n“There were slaps and uncomfortable noises at times – at one point the downwind sail fell in the sea and we were stomping above their cabin trying to pull it up, but they didn’t wake,” says Rich.\n“We’ve never been a tip-toey family. Jesse was just 12 days old the first time he went on a boat so they’re used to not having perfect sleeping conditions.”\n\nGrandad helped out at mealtimes. Credit: Stevens Family\n\nStef and Rich managed the shift from European to Caribbean time by working to sunset and sunrise.\n“We gave ourselves an extra hour of life over four days,” explains Stef. “Because we did it in increments everyone adapted. We’d say, ‘hello moon, hello stars,’ and it just made sense to Jesse that it was night-time.”\nThe daytime was more challenging. Just as Stef would get one boy down the other would wake. “I definitely didn’t twiddle my thumbs!” she says. “I didn’t read any books but I was still able to bake banana cakes, cookies and fresh bread. Morale was high on board!”\nWhen it came to preparing meals, Stef was glad she’d splashed out on a Vorwerk Thermomix – a portable cooker, blender, food processor and more.\n“It’s my luxury item,” she says. “It’s amazing! I’d be feeding Roux and making paella at the same time, you can just chuck the ingredients in and leave it.”\n\nInduction cooking hob saves having to carry too much gas. Credit: Ali Wood\n\nShe also used a low power induction hob. “We try and use as much electric as possible and limit gas as it’s safer and you don’t have to carry the gas bottles.”\nThere were times though, even with a hands-on crew and high-spec galley, that Stef found herself utterly exhausted.\n“Personally, I’d have liked to have done more sailing, but it didn’t work out that way. I remember day eight was a low point. I just needed mum support around me.”\nThe closest Stef got to this was via Zoom calls with friends back home, something she did twice a day using Starlink.\n\nThe family did not suffer from sea sickness, which made the Atlantic crossing easier. Credit: Stevens family\n\n“It was nice to reach out to friends. Some are having babies now, and yes, I do sometimes feel I’m missing out, but then we’re here, spending all this time with our kids and watching them grow. It’s amazing.”\nThe Stevens family have been cruising the Caribbean coast and aim to transit the Panama Canal early in 2025 for the South Pacific.

I said, ‘You’re kidding!’, but he said ‘No, this is the biggest mistake people make – you’ve got to get that resin into the first layer’. I did that and then put two coats of glassfibre on.”</p>\n<p>He found assembly straightforward.</p>\n<p>“I built the hull upside down, and then got eight or nine friends round to help turn the boat over. They were expecting a dinghy, but I was really surprised how light it was; she went over very easily.”</p>\n<p>Derek found he needed to add much more ballast than recommended. He filled the <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/boats/keel-types-and-how-they-affect-performance-76621\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keel</a> casing with concrete weighing 1.5 tons, but it still wasn’t enough.</p>\n<p>“She floated like a cork, so I melted down some lead and added another 1.5 tons of internal ballast,” he recalls. “I also put in a <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/expert-advice/how-to-retrofit-a-bow-thruster-90175\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bow thruster</a> because she is light on the bow.”</p>\n<p>Despite the cost – which finally added up to £34,000 – and the years of toil, Derek has no regrets.</p>\n<p>“I can honestly say I really did enjoy building it. I just don’t think people have the time now.”</p>\n<p>Ill health has sadly forced Derek to put AnnJilly on the market.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Richard Reed investigates the history of Cruiser Kits and its founder, Charles Greene\nAll Cruiser Kits boats, including Seven Summers, were made out of plywood and could be built at home. Credit: Richard Reed\nWhen I bought my plywood centre-cockpit Santa Barbara 32, Seven Summers, I’d never heard of Charles Greene or Cruiser Kits, writes Richard Reed.\nThat changed on the pontoon at Yarmouth on the Isle of Wight where, by pure chance, I met Malcolm Fieldhouse.\nHe’d been a teacher at the school next to the home of Seven Summers’ builder, the late Louis Louth-Davies, and had watched him build the ketch in his Barnham garden.\nIt started a quest to learn more about the company and the designer.\nCruiser Kits was founded by yacht designer Charles Greene – a name now sadly little known.\n\nJust some of the Cruiser Kits range. Credit: Cruiser Kits\n\nYet in the 1950s, Greene was the pioneer of modern plywood boatbuilding.\nIn its heyday, the company was incredibly successful, selling hundreds of kits and partially-completed boats in the UK and Europe, and winning rave reviews in Practical Boat Owner and other sailing magazines.\nCruiser Kits was a regular exhibitor at the Earl’s Court and Southampton boat shows and on the Continent.\nAt the Genoa Boat Show in 1963, the firm secured perhaps its biggest ever deal worth £100,000 – £2.8 million in today’s money – for 10, 60ft catamarans from a holiday firm in Sardinia.\nHowever, it was selling boats to hobbyists that was the firm’s bread and butter – with enthusiasts able to choose from more than 50 kits, ranging in size from a simple canoe for £16 to a 99ft trimaran for £7,500.\n\nCharles Greene (right), and Brian Gower (left) at a boat show talking to Robin Knox-Johnston, who later became a customer. Credit: Collen Gower\n\nYou could also buy partially assembled boats in three stages, buying the next section when the first had been completed.\nCruiser Kits even offered working holidays, which allowed clients to build their boats under supervision at Cruiser Kits’ headquarters in Suffolk.\nGreene grew up in The Creek, Sunbury, just off the Thames, and soon started experimenting with building makeshift boats with friends.\nAt 16 he signed up as an apprentice at the James Taylor boatyard at Chertsey, and showed early entrepreneurial flair, setting up a company and building a couple of boats in his spare time in a rented garage.\nHe worked for several yards on the South Coast and the Isle of Wight, before enlisting in the RAF at 19.\n\nThe Cruiser Kits factory where partially assembled boats were built ready for purchase. Credit: Cruiser Kits\n\nHe returned to Sunbury while waiting to be called up, working briefly at Walton Yacht Works.\nThe firm assigned him as being in a ‘reserved occupation’, but Greene got himself removed from the list. He wanted to fight.\nDuring this pre-war period, he developed several innovative boat designs, including multi-chine hulls and box keels, which he mentions in his book, Boatbuilding without Brainstorms, Blisters or Bankruptcy.\nGreene served in the RAF during World War II, flying Lancaster bombers, despite wearing contact lenses – pilots were supposed to have perfect eyesight.\n“He cheated by memorising the eye test,” says his daughter Shelley.\nAfter the war, Greene experimented with making a dinghy using plywood from an old landing craft, and realised what a strong yet lightweight and versatile material it was.\nHe bought more landing craft, and in 1951 he built a 29ft sloop, named Shelley after his daughter.\nThe idea for Cruiser Kits was born. After a brief spell working on rocket propulsion for the Royal Aircraft Research establishment at Farnborough, Greene started his boat business, and soon picked up orders.\nIn 1956, he moved the business to an old pub in Earsham, Norfolk, before buying a former water mill at Bungay, in Suffolk, as sales took off.\nEach of the models in the catalogue was built as a prototype, then disassembled, with the panels used as templates when a customer ordered a kit.\n\nOver 50 kit boats were available to buy. Credit: Cruiser Kits\n\n“Dad was the most wonderful designer, says Shelley. “If you went into his office his drawings were impeccable, all from\nAlthough Cruiser Kits sold a range of monohulls, catamarans and trimarans, she says her father was “very much into multihulls”.\nOne of Greene’s first employees, Brian Gower, remembers going to Tilbury docks in a pick-up truck to collect the plywood for the kits, and also went with Greene – affectionately known to everyone as Ginger, from his RAF days – to several boat shows, both at home and abroad.\nChay Blyth visited the yard at Bungay, and on another occasion, Brian delivered a dinghy kit to Robin Knox-Johnston.\nIn 1973, when the UK joined the Common Market, VAT was imposed on kit boats, which had previously been exempt from tax.\nThis, together with the supply of cheap glassfibre moulds for fitting out at home, sounded the death knell for Cruiser Kits, which was forced to lay off staff, and the company was wound up in the 1980s.\nTime, perhaps, to remember the place Charles Greene has earned in the annals of British yacht design and boatbuilding.\nA Cruiser Kits builder’s story\nDerek Lucas bought his flat-pack Cruiser Kits 38ft ketch for £6,000 in 1982, not long before the company went into liquidation.\nA carpenter by trade, he had the skills and the tools, but it still took him nearly 14 years to build, initially in his garden at Ryarsh, Kent, before finishing it off at Medway Bridge Marina.\nAnnJilly (named after his daughters) finished up as a motor cruiser rather than a sailing boat.\n\nAnnJilly under construction. Credit: Derek Lucas\n\n“By the time I finished it my wife had gone off boating so I never put the masts on,” he says.\nPerhaps because the company was close to shutting down, not all the interior panels fitted as well as they might have done, and Derek ended up remodelling the interior.\nHe also raised the aft cabin coachroof by a foot to give himself standing headroom.\n“I put an escape hatch in the aft cabin,” he adds. “It wasn’t until I finished it I realised that if there was a fire I wouldn’t otherwise be able to get out.”\nAll Cruiser Kits’ boats were designed to have a glassfibre sheathing to protect the top-quality plywood hull.\nDerek used a local factory in Tonbridge to supply the materials.\n\nOriginally a ketch, Derek ended up making AnnJilly a motor cruiser. Credit: Derek Lucas\n\n“They were really brilliant,” he remembers. “I’d smoothed the hull nicely, but he told me to put some nails in a block of wood and score it all up. I said, ‘You’re kidding!’, but he said ‘No, this is the biggest mistake people make – you’ve got to get that resin into the first layer’. I did that and then put two coats of glassfibre on.”\nHe found assembly straightforward.\n“I built the hull upside down, and then got eight or nine friends round to help turn the boat over. They were expecting a dinghy, but I was really surprised how light it was; she went over very easily.”\nDerek found he needed to add much more ballast than recommended. He filled the keel casing with concrete weighing 1.5 tons, but it still wasn’t enough.\n“She floated like a cork, so I melted down some lead and added another 1.5 tons of internal ballast,” he recalls. “I also put in a bow thruster because she is light on the bow.”\nDespite the cost – which finally added up to £34,000 – and the years of toil, Derek has no regrets.\n“I can honestly say I really did enjoy building it. I just don’t think people have the time now.”\nIll health has sadly forced Derek to put AnnJilly on the market.

Whilst there are many good examples of best practice, voluntary training and Harbour Authority guidance for safe operations, culture and education can only benefit those who wish to find this information and who wish to adopt it whilst not mandatory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While the UK’s Statutory Harbour Authorities are obligated to regulate and apply Safety Management Systems and safe operating directions for all marine activities within their statutory Harbour Limits, this can only be achieved through limited powers, such as making Harbour bylaws and General Directions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Harbour byelaws can only be made by any authority that have the powers to do so, byelaws must be within the scope of the<a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/news/should-harbour-authorities-have-unrestricted-power-3767\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> harbour authority’s byelaw-making powers</a>. They are used to regulate activities in the harbour, reflecting local circumstances and enabling the operation of the harbour to be conducted efficiently and safely.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Byelaw-making powers go beyond simple management to include a power to create criminal offences for breach of the bye-laws punishable on conviction in the courts by fines, with this in mind a bylaw can only be made if the underpinning laws and legislation exist as applicable.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Harbour authorities are required to consult users before advertising draft byelaws and byelaws must be confirmed by the relevant Minister.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Proposed new bylaws are often blocked by significant interest groups in regard to leisure craft activities, even when potential personal injury or a <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/specials/man-overboard-mob-in-a-marina-78877\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">risk to life</a> is assessed to be a possible outcome.</p>\n<p>The UK Harbour Masters Association along with the UK Ports Trade Associations such as the British Ports Association and UK Major Ports Group have for many years been lobbying for the national alcohol limits applicable to road users and commercial seafarers amongst others to be applied to those in command or control of leisure craft of any size in UK waters.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This sensible and reasonable lobbying for safe legislation to be made has consistently met with significant opposition from powerful organisations of interest, blocking the introduction of improved safety standards for all water users where ever in the UK.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is not possible for UK Statutory Harbour Authorities to legislate or regulate the non-commercial leisure craft sector without the underpinning legislation to be in place.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is therefore for the UK Government and its executive maritime agencies such as the DfT and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to create the required legislation, policy, standards and regulatory enforcement where required to improve operational safety within the under 13m non-commercial craft sector.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The UK’s Ports and Harbours associations shall continue to lobby the Government regarding introducing the required legislation to improve what is a tragic and reoccurring record of avoidable incidents and fatalities.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Article continues below&#8230;</em></p>\n\n\n<div id=\"accordion\" class=\"collection-wrapper list-large \">\n\n\t\t\t\t<article class=\"loop loop-list-large row

They are used to regulate activities in the harbour, reflecting local circumstances and enabling the operation of the harbour to be conducted efficiently and safely.\n“Byelaw-making powers go beyond simple management to include a power to create criminal offences for breach of the bye-laws punishable on conviction in the courts by fines, with this in mind a bylaw can only be made if the underpinning laws and legislation exist as applicable.\n“Harbour authorities are required to consult users before advertising draft byelaws and byelaws must be confirmed by the relevant Minister.\n“Proposed new bylaws are often blocked by significant interest groups in regard to leisure craft activities, even when potential personal injury or a risk to life is assessed to be a possible outcome.\nThe UK Harbour Masters Association along with the UK Ports Trade Associations such as the British Ports Association and UK Major Ports Group have for many years been lobbying for the national alcohol limits applicable to road users and commercial seafarers amongst others to be applied to those in command or control of leisure craft of any size in UK waters.\n“This sensible and reasonable lobbying for safe legislation to be made has consistently met with significant opposition from powerful organisations of interest, blocking the introduction of improved safety standards for all water users where ever in the UK.\n“It is not possible for UK Statutory Harbour Authorities to legislate or regulate the non-commercial leisure craft sector without the underpinning legislation to be in place.\n“It is therefore for the UK Government and its executive maritime agencies such as the DfT and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to create the required legislation, policy, standards and regulatory enforcement where required to improve operational safety within the under 13m non-commercial craft sector.\n“The UK’s Ports and Harbours associations shall continue to lobby the Government regarding introducing the required legislation to improve what is a tragic and reoccurring record of avoidable incidents and fatalities.”\n\nArticle continues below…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nJail for RIB driver who crashed into a buoy, causing the death of a passenger\nRIB driver Morgan George Smith, 21, of Northampton is now serving a three-year jail sentence for gross negligence manslaughter\nMan cleared of manslaughter in Truro as DfT plans alcohol limits for leisure mariners\nMan cleared of manslaughter in Truro as DfT plans alcohol limits for leisure mariners\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSailing the legendary 32ft cruiser, Damien from the Arctic Circle to Antarctica\nBetween 1969 and 1973, Jérôme Poncet and Gérard Janichon sailed their 32ft cutter Damien from Spitsbergen to Antarctica via the…\n\n\nDrunk sailing ‘impairs judgment’\nA Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) spokesperson said: “This was a tragic incident and the RNLI offers its sincere condolences to those involved. It is well documented that alcohol impairs judgement and reduces reaction time, so the RNLI would encourage anyone going afloat to avoid alcohol.\n“We also remind those who enjoy boating and sailing to wear an appropriate floatation device whilst afloat, and to always carry a means of calling for help in case of emergency.”\n\nA National Water Safety Forum spokesperson added: “The National Water Safety Forum extends its sincere condolences to those involved in this tragic incident.\n“We strongly advocate that anyone taking part in boating, sailing or any other water-based activity follows recommended water safety advice; this includes wearing the appropriate floatation device and avoiding the consumption of alcohol.\n“The use of alcohol or other substances affects judgment and reaction time, meaning it increases the chance of someone entering the water unexpectedly, and decreases the chance of surviving an incident when it does happen. We encourage everyone spending time on or near water to do so safely.\n“If you see people in trouble in the water, call 999, tell the person to float on their back, and throw them something that floats to help them until help arrives.”\nRead the Coroner’s ‘Prevention of Future Deaths’ Report in full at: www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/david-haw-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/",

Credit: Zoran Gloznic\nMy wooden motor cruiser Marabou was hauled out so I could start repair and renovation work.\nBeing retired, the budget is fairly tight so I plan to use every opportunity to reduce the cost but without compromising anything.\nDue to her size, age and engine power, Marabou must undergo a rigorous inspection every five years and she has to be hauled out for the task.\nAmong many other requirements, there must be a bilge water alarm installed, and for Marabou that means having two bilge alarm switches (or floats) installed: one in the engine area under the cockpit and another in the bilge under the main cabin.\nA quick look at some online chandleries confirmed that bilge floats are not cheap – anything from £20+ to £60 – and that’s for the least expensive floats of questionable quality which come without protective housing around the float itself.\n\nComponents required for the alarm switch and control panel. Credit: Zoran Gloznic\n\nThis type of float can easily be blocked by debris or whatever in the bilge and it may not activate the alarm when you need it.\nSo I decided to make the floats myself.\nThe goal was to have devices costing less than those from chandler but at the same time being reliable and simple to make.\nAfter spending some time searching online for various water level float switches, I purchased floats that could stand the voltage up to 110V and had 10W switch power which was more than enough for a buzzer and LED alarm light.\nI paid US$1.45 a piece including free delivery.\nThe floats are designed to be used in various liquids, among them saltwater aquariums so my guess was they’d be OK for marine applications.\n\nAssembled control panel. Green LED will be replaced with a red one. Credit: Zoran Gloznic\n\nFor the float enclosure, I bought plastic boxes for electronic projects.\nThey came with watertight seals – not necessary for this application – and the cost was about the same for each box as for the floats.\nWhen everything arrived I was happy to find the float wires were well sealed and tinned as specified.\nI kept the floats submerged for about a week and could not see any damage – not a very sophisticated test, but it did show that they can live submerged for some time.\nIn real life, they should never be submerged except if the level of water in the bilges goes up due to bilge pump failure or some more serious problem!\nThe float is well made, the moving part moves easily and the wires are long enough to keep the connection to the boat wiring high enough so they should never be submerged.\n\nReverse side of the control panel. Credit: Zoran Gloznic\n\nWith the boxes, I was happy to see the encased nuts were made from non-ferrous metal that looked like brass – not exactly a good choice for use in a marine environment – but if, or rather when, they fail it’ll be easy to drill the box through and install longer screws with nuts to keep the cover on.\nIn my inventory of various electronic components, I located a small, plastic 12V buzzer, a push-button with non-ferrous body and a small 12V LED indicator light.\nI used all of this to make a simple control panel for the alarm switch.\nThe buzzer was mounted behind a round hole covered with very fine stainless steel wire mesh.\nI’m planning to replace the green LED with a red one – red seems a more appropriate colour for an alarm light.\n\nHow the float is installed inside its protective box. Credit: Zoran Gloznic\n\nWhen the push-button is pressed it will bypass the float and connect the buzzer and the alarm light directly to the boat’s 12V power source – so the buzzer and the light can be tested from time to time.\nAs for testing the float itself, the only way to do it is to remove the cover from the float housing and manually lift the moving float part.\nAfter making the control panel, I drilled a series of holes on the sides of the box and also a hole to mount the float.\nIt’s important to have the box large enough so the float’s moving part can move easily up and down inside it.\nAnd voila! I now have a float switch with a simple control panel, all made in less than two hours with a total cost of about £6.\nTime will tell how long it will last, but I’m planning to make one or two more and keep them on the boat as spares.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nInstalling a Wavestream 1 bilge filter\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nDirty, oily bilge water from your boat’s hull can be filtered to protect marine life.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "If your engine fails to start, being able to berth your boat using the tender is an extremely useful skill, as Ben Meakins demonstrates\nHow manoeuvrable can your boat be just by using a small dinghy. We put it to the test\nBoat towing and berthing by tender\nThat heart-sinking moment when you press the engine starter to hear nothing but a ‘click’ is one of those situations when you have to weigh up whether to call for a tow or attempt to ‘self-rescue’ and make it to port under your own steam.\nI was sailing in Norway a few years ago when the starter motor broke.\nWe managed to limp into a nearby marina using the dinghy to tow us.\nIn the heat of the moment, it was a nerve-wracking business, and would have been much easier if we’d done some experimenting beforehand.\nIn the event, we made it into an easy berth: but I’ve since wondered just how manoeuvrable you can be with a small dinghy powering a large yacht.\nTo help us find out, Mark Carey kindly lent us his smart Laser 28 Zorra for an afternoon.\nShe’s moored in Parkstone Yacht Haven in Poole Harbour: the club’s marina is a tight squeeze inside its large stone breakwater, and we had an unusually still day in early February to play with.\nWe inflated my venerable 1978 Avon Redstart dinghy with its 2hp Mariner outboard of a similar vintage as motive power, and cast off to see how easy it was – or if it was even possible – to control the yacht with the dinghy.\nBoat towing & berthing: Securing the dinghy\n\nWe used the painter attachment point and the straps for the aft thwart to lash the dinghy alongside before boat towing\n\nIt’s worth taking your time when lashing the dinghy alongside.\nIt needs to be as far aft as possible so that, ideally, the engine is aft of the yacht’s rudder.\nYou’ll need two springs – one fore, one aft – to take the strain of the tow, and two breast lines to keep the dinghy attached in the turns.\nThe whole lot needs to be as tight as possible to make manoeuvring comparatively crisp and easy.\nWe used the Avon’s painter attachment point and two sturdy webbing seat brackets at the stern.\nThe large height difference between the dinghy and yacht makes this potentially tricky – we got around it by taking the stern breast line across to the dinghy’s port side, which pulled the dinghy in tight and held her securely.\nBoat towing & berthing: Getting used to manoeuvring\nIn the relatively open water off the PkYC slipway, we had just enough space to put in a few turns and manoeuvres to get to grips with Zorra’s now altered handling.\nWith David Pugh in the tender and myself on the helm, we turned to port and starboard.\nA few things quickly became obvious: the boat turned much more readily with the dinghy on the inside of the turn as the prop wash from the outboard pushed the stern around, with Zorra pirouetting in her own length.\n\nTurning to port, with the dinghy on the inside…\n\nTurning to starboard, with the dinghy on the outside of the turn, was slower: it’s no great problem, but you need to be aware of it and plan accordingly.\nWith a few turns completed, we opted to try manoeuvring at low speed, ahead and astern.\nWith a small outboard, this took some time, and we soon learned that it was important to increase the engine’s revs gently.\n\n… was easier than with the dinghy on the outside\n\nGoing ahead from a standing start, we found that the dinghy’s prop, offset as it was to port, pushed the boat’s bow to starboard.\nWe found that it helped to steer into the boat’s side to keep her true. Once the yacht started to move, we could centre the engine and she responded normally.\nBeing able to ‘vector’ the outboard through 360° gave us some flexibility.\nWe soon found that while the yacht was stopped, applying power to the outboard made it act more as a thruster than as motive power until the yacht had some way on.\nTherefore the steering angle of the outboard was critical, as was communication between myself on the helm and David in the dinghy.\nGoing hard astern to stop the boat was a case in point.\nWith the propeller offset to the port side of the yacht, the bow would swing wildly to port when power was applied in reverse, so it was important to go astern with the engine vectored slightly to starboard to keep the boat going straight into the berth.\nToo much, however, and the prop acted as a stern thruster and walked the stern to starboard – a useful tool to bring her alongside, but potentially dangerous when easing into a tight marina berth.\nAfter spending 15 minutes entertaining the onlookers with pirouettes and shouted commands, we began to get the hang of things and settled on a system of hand signals to show David which way to steer the dinghy and the amount of throttle needed.\nStuck down at water level, he could see very little, and it was obvious that he was simply the engine room: the helm of the yacht needed to be in command.\nBoat towing & berthing: Going astern\n\nTo test the efficiency of towing backwards we cast off and used the dinghy in astern to pull the boat out of the berth.\nThis was surprisingly successful, and steering was actually easier than with the boat going ahead.\nBy synchronising tiller and outboard positions we found we could steer very accurately, and managed to make our way down a narrow aisle.\nBerthing ahead: first failure\nOur first attempt had the pontoon to starboard and on the inside of the turn.\nIt didn’t go well, but we were able to abort the manoeuvre before any harm was done.\n\n1. With a little tide running, we approached the space without issue until we turned into the berth and applied some astern power, as you would under normal circumstances.\n\n2. This combination pivoted Zorra around her keel because we applied too much astern power to the offset prop with the outboard’s tiller positioned fore-and-aft.\nAt the same time, I was steering Zorra to port, and she simply spun on her keel. No contact was made, but it was a useful lesson to apply power slowly and have clear communications to vector the engine correctly in astern.\nBoat towing & berthing: Bigger berth, starboard turn\n\n1. We decided to try another, bigger, berth – also requiring a turn to starboard.\n\n2. We were nervous after the previous close call, and applied some reverse power too soon. Again, no harm done, but we were realising that you need some way on the boat when approaching.\n\n3. Leaving the engine idling in slow astern, steering the outboard as necessary until it was time to apply a burst of power to stop the boat at the last minute, proved much more effective.\n\n4. The tender holds her steady into the berth.\nSame berth, port turn entrance\n\n1. This time we approached with the pontoon to port and on the outside of the turn. This was more successful: the dinghy was always pushing the boat into the berth.\n\n2. By aiming the bow into the corner between the finger pontoon and the main walkway she ended up in the right place…\n\n3. … and David could apply power at 90° to the boat to push Zorra’s stern alongside.\nLet’s try the first berth again\n\n1. With a much better idea of how the boat handled, we opted to attempt our first tricky berth again, this time approaching from the opposite direction (pontoon on the outside of the turn, dinghy inside).\n\n2. This time we left the tender’s outboard idling, and with clear communication used it to either boost or check the boat’s way. We aimed at the inner end of the finger pontoon and glided in.\n\n3. David finally checked our progress into the berth with a well-timed burst of astern and starboard engine that also brought Zorra’s stern in to the pontoon – perfect!\nLessons Learned: Practice makes perfect\nBerthing with the tender proved a useful exercise, becoming much easier with each attempt.\n\nEffective communication is vital, especially over the racket of a noisy outboard motor\n\nWhile we hope we’ll rarely have to use this skill, we now have a good idea of how to manoeuvre the boat with a small-engined dinghy and would recommend every skipper take the opportunity to try it.\n1. Communication is vital\nThe helmsman of the yacht is the one who needs to be in charge, and should give clear instructions to the crew in the dinghy – ‘slow ahead’, ‘ahead, steer half port’, that sort of thing.\n2. It’s useful to have a spare crewman to help tie up\nHaving a crew member ready to step off with a bow spring to stop the boat in the chosen berth would have been very useful.\nShort-handed berthing was possible, but slightly nerve-wracking!\n3. The engine works as a ‘bow thruster’ until you get moving\nThe most striking thing we learned was that until the outboard is in charge and the boat is going the way you want, the outboard is only really working as a glorified thruster.\nYou need to pay particular attention to the engine’s orientation, and practise (in an open bit of water) how the engine’s throttle and steering affect the boat at slow speeds – and especially when changing from bursts of ahead to astern.\n4. It’s easier with the dinghy inside the turn and the pontoon outside \nWe found approaching a berth with the pontoon on the inside of the turn much trickier.\nThat’s true for normal boat handling, but is exacerbated in this case by the need to have the tender on the outside to avoid it colliding with the pontoon.\nWith an easily-handled, modern boat like Zorra, it would even be worth going past the berth in astern to gain the correct approach.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSolo sailing tips – anchoring and berthing\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAndrew Blyth, who regularly sails his 9m Maurice Griffiths cutter single-handed, describes a selection of methods for dealing with tricky…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBerthing a boat using wind and tide\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nManoeuvring a boat into and out of a berth is one of the most frequent handling challenges facing boat owners…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nEasy berthing with a boat pick-up line\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBill Rothwell devises a simple boat pick-up line to make berthing easier\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBerthing a vessel: 2 clever ways with warps\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIn these days of fin keels, bow-thrusters and powerful engines, using warps for marina manoeuvres might seem an old-fashioned irrelevance…\nWant to read more practical articles like Boat towing and berthing by tender?\n\nA subscription to Practical Boat Owner magazine costs around 40% less than the cover price.\nPrint and digital editions are available through Magazines Direct – where you can also find the latest deals.\nPBO is packed with information to help you get the most from boat ownership – whether sail or power.\nTake your DIY skills to the next level with trusted advice on boat maintenance and repairs\nImpartial in-depth gear reviews\nPractical cruising tips for making the most of your time afloat\nFollow us on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter",

I could now do final alignment checks before the final fit.</p>\n<p>Once back in the water, I did the feeler gauge check on the R&amp;D coupling as per the instructions.

Or perhaps one of the occasional dings and scrapes suffered by my Jeanneau Voyagè 12.5 Cascadeur in use as a school boat?\nWhen I bought Cascadeur in 2011, it was for the express purpose of using her as a sail training vessel, initially with my own school, but later with a well-known Southampton-based sailing academy.\nNow, as a recently retired cruising instructor, I know that for students to learn they have to be allowed to make some mistakes.\nThe instructor’s job is to see the adverse situation developing, and then to intercede just after the student realises their error, but before serious harm happens.\nNot always an easy task, and sometimes the take-over is post, rather than prior to, the impact!\n\nBruno Brown’s Jeanneau Voyage 12.5 Cascadeur, Credit: Bruno Brown\n\nSo thorough regular inspections of the boat are very necessary!\nNoticing a drip from Cassie’s stern gland, as soon as she was lifted for annual inspection and service I removed the shaft seal bellows.\nWhat I found was the engine had clearly shifted to port at some point, most probably due to two of the engine mount height-adjuster nuts working loose, and had happily ground away part of the side of the stern tube!\nHence the leak.\nWhat was also immediately obvious was that dezincification had got to the point that the tube needed replacing anyway.\n\nOriginal stern tube worn away on one side. Credit: Bruno Brown\n\nMy surveyor had condemned the original through-hull fittings and seacocks a year earlier, leading to their total replacement, so this was no great surprise.\nHow to go about the job? Obviously, it was going to involve a new shaft, cutless bearing, R&D coupling and engine mounts as well as the stern tube itself.\nSo having checked with my surveyor that he was happy with a composite tube, I ordered most of the stuff from the very helpful staff at T Norris.\nThe stern tube on the Voyage is not actually that long, about 40cm in total, but to get the old tube out I tried various ever-increasingly brutal methods until I found one that worked for me.\nI used my Dremel with a cut-off wheel to cut the tube internally into two lengths.\n\nGround away aft end of the stern tube – note pink tinge of dezincified metal. Credit: Bruno Brown\n\nI then found that I could power-file a groove through the now-sectioned wall of the tube, such that I could collapse it inwards to free it up.\nDuring the process, I power-filed the filler off the outboard end of the tube.\nHaving finally got the remains of the tube out, I then was faced with the task of cleaning up the hole.\nI used a 60mm flapper wheel on my battery drill to great effect, using the long mandrel from a hole-saw kit to reach right into the tube (the shaft of the flapper wheel was exactly the same size as the pilot drill in the hole-cutter set! How lucky is that?).\n\nGroove filed in tube wall so it can be collapsed inwards. Credit: Bruno Brown\n\nI had a Henry vacuum cleaner running inside the boat throughout this phase of the job to minimise dust.\nThat left me with a nice, clean hole into which I could start rebuilding the whole thing.\nI started with the engine mounts, swapping them one at a time and approximating the height of each new one based on the original mount dimensions.\nI supported each corner of the engine with a scissor jack while swapping the mounts.\nI’d made sure before ordering the mounts that the securing holes of the new ones were the same as the originals.\n\nThe stern tube cut off, filled and faired with the hull. Credit: Bruno Brown\n\nChanging the mounts was a relatively easy task, but it took a bit of ingenuity in holding the mounting-bolt retaining nuts; long-reach locking pliers proved ideal.\nI then fitted the R&D clamp and split shaft couplings, and set about aligning everything with the new shaft and cutless bearing.\nFortunately, short sections of the old cutless bearing would just fit inside each end of the bore of the new stern tube, so I had a nicely centred shaft and stern tube acting effectively as one unit to centre between the new cutless bearing in the P-bracket and the bore of the split coupling on the gearbox end.\nI then spent a happy day tweaking the engine mount adjusters to get a beautiful sliding fit of the prop shaft into the gearbox split coupling together with no load on the cutless bearing.\n\nOutboard end view of the stern tube glued in. Credit: Bruno Brown\n\nTime then to look at glueing in the stern tube.\nI had on average about 3mm clearance between the outside diameter of the new stern tube and the aperture in the boat.\nWhat I needed was a wonder filler to secure the tube into the aperture.\nInitially, I was worried that I might get some voids during this process, but I asked a professional who put my mind at rest with the advice that “The middle isn’t that important, just make sure it’s a good job at each end!”\nI satisfied myself that I could use epoxy so my jollop of choice was West’s Six10 thickened self-mixing epoxy in a tube that fits a standard cartridge gun.\nI have to say that this is brilliant stuff – just squirt it in! I taped up the inboard end of the tube to protect it while I thoroughly packed the gap with the Six10 from the outboard end.\n\nTest fit showing everything fits at the inboard end. Credit: Bruno Brown\n\nI then packed and filleted the inboard end using the Six10 that had extruded through.\nWhen this stage had cured, I cut off the extraneous external bit of stern tube to replicate the shape of the original, then feathered back the inside of the tube and the adjacent original GRP on the hull to allow me to completely cover the external end of the tube with several layers of very fine glass cloth using West resin, extending to 30mm or so onto the feathered original hull GRP surface.\nWith the new resin washed and abraded, a spot of filling and fairing followed by several coats of epoxy primer finished the job ready for the antifouling. I could now do final alignment checks before the final fit.\nOnce back in the water, I did the feeler gauge check on the R&D coupling as per the instructions. I found no need for any further adjustment.\n\nJob done and everything back together inside. Credit: Bruno Brown\n\nReplacing a stern tube is one of those tasks that I think strikes fear into most of us and while this started out looking like a very daunting task, taking it one step at a time meant the job turned out to be surprisingly easy!\nThe necessary skills needed are just some experience working with resins and glass cloth, and an awareness of dust hazards, but that’s about it.\nIn terms of equipment, I didn’t find the need for anything particularly special other than the items mentioned in the article and masks etc for good dust protection.\nIn terms of time, it took me about three weeks overall including weighing-up time, awaiting spares… and Christmas!\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBoat propeller: How to choose the right one for your boat\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThe correct prop can have a dramatic effect on your boat's performance.

Credit: Johner Images/Getty</figcaption></figure><p>Can the AIS Net Location Beacon App be used for coastal cruising?</p>\n<p>We sail the coastal area out of Plymouth in our Moody 27.</p>\n<p>I’ve put off fitting AIS in part due to the very high cost and secondly because of the very few occasions of coastal fog where it would be a useful additional safety device.</p>\n<p>Could I download an AIS Net Location Beacon app as a cheaper useful additional aid in poor visibility for coastal passages?</p>\n<p><strong>Alan Eves </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Duncan Kent replies: </strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, web-based AIS platforms are not entirely reliable as they don’t always update in real-time and only work when your device is connected to the Internet.</p>\n<p>Some boat owners fit receive-only AIS devices (known as AIS Class B), which are considerably cheaper than the full two-way transceiver units.</p>\n<p>However, I believe it’s equally important to be seen as to see others at night or in limited visibility.</p>\n<p>AIS is a very useful collision avoidance device, which is certainly worth having if you ever plan to sail across the Channel.</p>\n<p>It not only allows you to see other vessels and receive warnings if they are on a possible collision course, but it also gives you the MMSI of the vessels displayed so you can direct dial them over the VHF radio to ask if you’re at all in doubt of their intentions.</p>\n<p>In thick fog, though, I’d rather have a good-quality radar set from which I could see land and navigate into a safe port if needed.</p>\n<p>Having both would obviously be the perfect solution, but I understand that’s a serious investment for a relatively small cruising boat.</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"accordion\"

Credit: Johner Images/Getty\nCan the AIS Net Location Beacon App be used for coastal cruising?\nWe sail the coastal area out of Plymouth in our Moody 27.\nI’ve put off fitting AIS in part due to the very high cost and secondly because of the very few occasions of coastal fog where it would be a useful additional safety device.\nCould I download an AIS Net Location Beacon app as a cheaper useful additional aid in poor visibility for coastal passages?\nAlan Eves \nDuncan Kent replies: \nUnfortunately, web-based AIS platforms are not entirely reliable as they don’t always update in real-time and only work when your device is connected to the Internet.\nSome boat owners fit receive-only AIS devices (known as AIS Class B), which are considerably cheaper than the full two-way transceiver units.\nHowever, I believe it’s equally important to be seen as to see others at night or in limited visibility.\nAIS is a very useful collision avoidance device, which is certainly worth having if you ever plan to sail across the Channel.\nIt not only allows you to see other vessels and receive warnings if they are on a possible collision course, but it also gives you the MMSI of the vessels displayed so you can direct dial them over the VHF radio to ask if you’re at all in doubt of their intentions.\nIn thick fog, though, I’d rather have a good-quality radar set from which I could see land and navigate into a safe port if needed.\nHaving both would obviously be the perfect solution, but I understand that’s a serious investment for a relatively small cruising boat.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOcean Signal RescueME PLB3 locator beacon with AIS\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nRupert Holmes tests the Ocean Signal RescueME PLB3, one of the first personal locator beacons on the market with personal…\n£475.00\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nShould I replace my old radar with cheaper AIS and tablet?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nI have a question I would be very pleased if you would put to your expert in electronics.
