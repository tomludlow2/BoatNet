How much power these use depends on the screen and RGB brightness levels. With the screen on 100% and the RGB on full the screen consumes between 350-700mA. It varies depending on what images are being displayed and what light pattern you are using,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The official specifications suggest a power usage of 5-7.6W. This would translate to current draw of 1-1.5A @ 5V. For this reason Elecrow recommend you use a 5V 2A power supply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried powering it using two methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Method 1</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Connect the screen&#8217;s Touch microUSB to a Pi USB port. Then connect the screen&#8217;s Power microUSB to another Pi USB port. This is possible with a Pi 2 and Pi 4. BUT you have to keep the power consumption of the screen within the capabilities of the USB port. This is easier with a Pi 4 but full brightness can sometimes cause the screen to flicker. I would recommend on setting the screen brightness to 70% and the RGB level to medium.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Method 2</strong> (recommended)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Connect the screen&#8217;s Touch microUSB to a Pi USB port. Then connect the screen&#8217;s Power microUSB directly to its own power supply. This ensures the screen has the power it needs without overloading the USB port on the Pi. This may be especially important if the Pi is being used with other USB devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Resolution &amp; HDMI Connection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The screen has a native resolution of 1280&#215;800 but will accept an HDMI signal of 1920&#215;1080. When connected to a Pi running the Raspberry Pi OS the display settings allowed me to switch between the two resolutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It depends on your project but I preferred to set it to 1280&#215;800 as this made the interface more practical to use via the touch interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Touchscreen Interface</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The screen itself is really nice. It&#8217;s bright, clear and the Raspberry Pi OS desktop looks great on it. The touch interface is responsive and I managed to use it to navigate the OS interface. Obviously hitting the tiny interface features such as the windows minimise icon is tricky. But no one buys a 10 inch touch screen to use a desktop operating system. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">RGB LED Light Patterns</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A key feature of the Meteor screen is the array of RGB LEDs mounted around the edge of the case. They are nicely integrated into the design and don&#8217;t get in the way. There are 19 preset light patterns and these can be changed using the rocker switch on the top edge. There are a set of patterns that are just solid colours if you prefer that look.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Elecrow Meteor IPS Touchscreen RGB Light Patterns\" width=\"708\" height=\"398\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1SKhe9A9qY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The RGB lights have three different brightness levels but can be switched off completely if required.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pi Touchscreen Software Configuration</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All I needed to do to get the screen to work was plug in the 3 cables and power up the Pi. That was it. The Pi booted up and the desktop was shown on the screen. The touch interface worked straight away without any additional software. This screen is truly plug-and-play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to create the SD card for the Pi I used the <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Official Pi SD Card Imager tool.</a> Using the advanced options I preset the WiFi details so when I booted up I the system was ready to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may want to attach a USB/Bluetooth keyboard to make your initial setup easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Case</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The screen is mounted in an acrylic case. It is nice and compact, encasing the screen without adding too much bulk, The recessed sockets of the back make it suitable for flush mounting it on a wall or within a custom cabinet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/meteor-ips-screen-01.jpg\" alt=\"Elecrow Meteor 10.1 inch IPS Touchscreen connected to a Raspberry Pi 4 via the HDMI interface\" class=\"wp-image-9263\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/meteor-ips-screen-01.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/meteor-ips-screen-01-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/meteor-ips-screen-01-150x113.jpg 150w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/meteor-ips-screen-01-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/meteor-ips-screen-01-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Additional Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A user manual would be nice to clearly explain the features and power arrangements.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The RGB lighting may not be for everyone. So you may want to consider another screen if you don’t want the RGB lighting.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can’t control the RGB lighting from the Pi. Would be awesome if you could control colour, pattern and brightness. Perhaps via the touch USB port or an I2C header.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Things I Liked</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nice screen with a good level of clarity. &#8211; clear, crisp, bright</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Brightness adjustment is easy to use</li>\n\n\n\n<li>RGB lighting is easy to use and brightness is easy to adjust</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Touchscreen works well with no configuration required</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Buttons are discrete</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Acrylic case/surround is well constructed</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Form factor is useful for various mounting options given it is nice and flat. Cables can be recessed so the screen could be stuck to a flat surface. Or sunk into a cabinet.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Possible Projects</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The possible projects you could use this screen in are endless but here are a few possibilities:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Raspberry Pi project screen</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Secondary monitor for PC</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Screen for retro-gaming system</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Home Assistant control panel</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Additional screen for a laptop</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Elecrow Meteor is a great Pi screen and definitely worth considering if you need a touch screen for your Raspberry Pi project. It&#8217;s quick to deploy using the acrylic feet but equally easy to stick to a flat surface. The HDMI input means it can be used with any device or computer that has an HDMI output.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Buy a Meteor 10.1 inch IPS Touchscreen</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to take a look at the official page then head over to Elecrow to check out the <a href=\"https://www.elecrow.com/10-1-ips-hdmi-touch-screen-with-rgb-animated-light-capactivie-screen-compatible-with-raspberry-pi-jetson-nano-beaglebone.html?ann=7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Meteor 10.1 IPS Touchscreen product page</a>.

For this reason Elecrow recommend you use a 5V 2A power supply.\nI tried powering it using two methods.\nMethod 1\nConnect the screen’s Touch microUSB to a Pi USB port. Then connect the screen’s Power microUSB to another Pi USB port. This is possible with a Pi 2 and Pi 4. BUT you have to keep the power consumption of the screen within the capabilities of the USB port. This is easier with a Pi 4 but full brightness can sometimes cause the screen to flicker. I would recommend on setting the screen brightness to 70% and the RGB level to medium.\nMethod 2 (recommended)\nConnect the screen’s Touch microUSB to a Pi USB port. Then connect the screen’s Power microUSB directly to its own power supply. This ensures the screen has the power it needs without overloading the USB port on the Pi. This may be especially important if the Pi is being used with other USB devices.\nResolution & HDMI Connection\nThe screen has a native resolution of 1280×800 but will accept an HDMI signal of 1920×1080. When connected to a Pi running the Raspberry Pi OS the display settings allowed me to switch between the two resolutions.\nIt depends on your project but I preferred to set it to 1280×800 as this made the interface more practical to use via the touch interface.\nThe Touchscreen Interface\nThe screen itself is really nice. It’s bright, clear and the Raspberry Pi OS desktop looks great on it. The touch interface is responsive and I managed to use it to navigate the OS interface. Obviously hitting the tiny interface features such as the windows minimise icon is tricky. But no one buys a 10 inch touch screen to use a desktop operating system. \nRGB LED Light Patterns\nA key feature of the Meteor screen is the array of RGB LEDs mounted around the edge of the case. They are nicely integrated into the design and don’t get in the way. There are 19 preset light patterns and these can be changed using the rocker switch on the top edge. There are a set of patterns that are just solid colours if you prefer that look.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RGB lights have three different brightness levels but can be switched off completely if required.\nPi Touchscreen Software Configuration\nAll I needed to do to get the screen to work was plug in the 3 cables and power up the Pi. That was it. The Pi booted up and the desktop was shown on the screen. The touch interface worked straight away without any additional software. This screen is truly plug-and-play.\nIn order to create the SD card for the Pi I used the Official Pi SD Card Imager tool. Using the advanced options I preset the WiFi details so when I booted up I the system was ready to use.\nYou may want to attach a USB/Bluetooth keyboard to make your initial setup easier.\nThe Case\nThe screen is mounted in an acrylic case. It is nice and compact, encasing the screen without adding too much bulk, The recessed sockets of the back make it suitable for flush mounting it on a wall or within a custom cabinet.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Thoughts\nA user manual would be nice to clearly explain the features and power arrangements.\nThe RGB lighting may not be for everyone. So you may want to consider another screen if you don’t want the RGB lighting.\nYou can’t control the RGB lighting from the Pi. Would be awesome if you could control colour, pattern and brightness. Perhaps via the touch USB port or an I2C header.\nThings I Liked\nNice screen with a good level of clarity. – clear, crisp, bright\nBrightness adjustment is easy to use\nRGB lighting is easy to use and brightness is easy to adjust\nTouchscreen works well with no configuration required\nButtons are discrete\nAcrylic case/surround is well constructed\nForm factor is useful for various mounting options given it is nice and flat. Cables can be recessed so the screen could be stuck to a flat surface. Or sunk into a cabinet.\nPossible Projects\nThe possible projects you could use this screen in are endless but here are a few possibilities:\nRaspberry Pi project screen\nSecondary monitor for PC\nScreen for retro-gaming system\nHome Assistant control panel\nAdditional screen for a laptop\nFinal Conclusion\nThe Elecrow Meteor is a great Pi screen and definitely worth considering if you need a touch screen for your Raspberry Pi project. It’s quick to deploy using the acrylic feet but equally easy to stick to a flat surface. The HDMI input means it can be used with any device or computer that has an HDMI output.\nBuy a Meteor 10.1 inch IPS Touchscreen\nIf you want to take a look at the official page then head over to Elecrow to check out the Meteor 10.1 IPS Touchscreen product page.

There are three custom white PCBs, two ribbon cables and the SD card adaptor to install. The ribbon cable connectors require some care but overall everything is plug-n-play. The Pi itself is cleverly held in place with magnets.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_13.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9151\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_13.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_13-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_13-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_13-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_13-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This setup is quite nice and avoids the messy cabling seen in other Pi based products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only issue I had with this setup is that changing the SD cards is fiddly because the fan board needs to be removed or at least loosened first. It&#8217;s worth installing both SD cards before you complete the assembly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Screen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The CrowPi L has a 11.6-inch 1366&#215;768 screen and the brightness can be controlled via the F9 and F10 keys. The viewing angles and colours are fine. Where the screen is a bit of a let down is the clarity of fonts. This may be something that can be improved in software but smaller text lacks the crisp edges of higher resolution screens. Even when the browser is zoomed in some lettering isn&#8217;t as clear as I would expect it to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However it should be noted that it is easy to plug in an external monitor. For desk based experimenting an additional monitor is always useful and the extra screen space makes programming easier. Even on my Thinkpad or work Elitebook I prefer using external monitors for development tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Battery &amp; Power</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5000mAh battery can be charged using the USB-C port on the right-hand side. To get an idea of run time I charged it up and played YouTube videos, watched live news broadcasts and did some browsing. It lasted over 4 hours which was significantly past the 3 hours stated by Elecrow. It was good to have my expectations exceeded. Obviously this run time would vary depending on use but anything over 3 hours is excellent for this type of device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The power button can be used to power up the Pi but to shutdown the Pi you need to do a software &#8220;Shutdown&#8221; from within the operating system. Holding down the power button will cut the power without a proper shutdown sequence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The custom image includes a widget in the taskbar that gives an indication of remaining battery charge. It&#8217;s a 4 segment battery icon. This is a vital feature for a laptop but I would have liked to see some sort of percentage indicator to get a better idea of remaining charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cooling Fan</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The GPIO bridge PCB includes a small fan which cools the Pi 4. This fan runs continuously and you can hear it. I didn&#8217;t find it annoying but the sound is there. The warm air is pushed out of the vent on the base of the CrowPi L. This works fine as long as there is air-flow to the bottom of the case. If you put the CrowPi L on a soft surface (such as a sofa or a bed) it is possible that the vent would be blocked and the fan would struggle to cool the Pi. This isn&#8217;t a problem as long as you are careful where the device is placed. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keyboard/Mouse/Touch-pad</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The keyboard is as expected on a laptop in this price range and is perfectly adequate for it&#8217;s intend purpose. Given that three of the Pi&#8217;s USB ports are available, an external keyboard can be added if you prefer the feel of a larger keyboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_06.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9149\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_06.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_06-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_06-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_06-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_06-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The included mouse is a compact and light model. It uses a USB dongle and is therefore easy to swap with another model if you want something bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The small touch-pad doesn&#8217;t look very impressive but was surprisingly usable. Using the mouse is a more practical option but the touch-pad is useful for quick tasks if you don&#8217;t have the mouse to hand. Larger touch-pads are available on other laptops but this would have increased the overall size of the CrowPi L.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dual microSD-card Adapter</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This adaptor allows you to fit two microSD-cards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cards can be selected using a simple A-B switch. This allows you to switch between two different operating systems. I placed the CrowPi L image in one slot and a RetroPie card in the other. By using the switch I could use the laptop for programming or games as required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only real issue with this setup is that replacing the SD cards is quite tricky. To get the cards out you need to partially lift off the GPIO bridge PCB which isn&#8217;t easy as it is firmly held in place with 2 banks of 40 pins. It&#8217;s a fantastic feature but it works best if you don&#8217;t change the cards very often.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Internal microSD-card Slot</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an additional microSD-card slot that can be used to provide additional storage. It could be used to store code and projects without using the Pi&#8217;s main SD card.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Audio</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two speakers mounted on the rear surface giving the CrowPi L stereo audio capability. The volume can be adjusted from within the OS. As with most laptops you may need full volume in a noisy environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_09.jpg\" alt=\"CrowPi L Speaker\" class=\"wp-image-9154\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_09.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_09-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_09-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_09-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_09-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This photo also shows the small feet which lift the CrowPi L off a flat surface.

This is a hardware kit that contains 22 modules that can be plugged into a base shield. The CrowPi L comes with it&#8217;s own base shield so with this kit it is possible to use it with another standalone Pi and share the modules. The instruction book contains a number of projects that explain how to connect up the hardware. The built-in software lessons guide you through creating the code to make use of the modules.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"696\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_02.jpg\" alt=\"CrowTail Starter Kit\" class=\"wp-image-9141\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_02.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_02-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_02-150x104.jpg 150w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_02-450x313.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/crowpi_l_02-768x535.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Modules include almost all the sensors and output devices you might want to experiment with.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "CrowPi L is a Raspberry Pi 4 based laptop created by Elecrow. It is a slightly different variation of the CrowPi 2 which was released in the summer or 2020. The idea is that the device is as portable as a laptop but with the ability to interface with the Pi’s various connectors and GPIO header.\nElecrow sent me a CrowPi L and Crowtail Starter Kit to review. They placed no restrictions on me and this article is my honest unbiased opinion.\n\n\n\n\nThe packaging is all very professional and no different to items you might buy in a retail shop.\nSo lets take a look at the specification:\nCrowPi L Hardware Specification\n11.6-inch 1366×768 IPS screen\n5000mAh internal battery (~3 hour runtime)\nBuilt-in keyboard and mini-touchpad\n40-pin GPIO interface\nExternal HDMI socket\nDual miniSD-card adapter with switch\nMagnetic mount for Pi board\nInternal cooling fan\n1.1Kg\n291(L)*190(W]*46(H)mm\n\n\n\n\nPi Ports\nOn the lefthand side you have the following ports available:\nEthernet socket\n2 USB 3.0\n1 USB 2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the right-hand side you have:\nGPIO connector\n3.5mm Audio Jack\nHDMI\nUSB-C power socket (12V 2A)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\nElecrow provide a microSD-card image which includes a customised operating system. It is based on the Raspberry Pi OS but there are:\n40 Letscode lessons – using a Scratch-like graphical programming system\n56 Python lessons – a mixture of software and/or hardware lessons\nPi Panel user interface providing links to all learning materials\nBattery widget to show remaining capacity\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\nLaptop Shell\nThe most obvious feature is the main laptop style shell that encases the Pi 4. This is white plastic with a slightly textured matte finish.\n\n\n\n\nIt has two panels on the bottom. One screwed in place to house the battery and the other for the Pi compartment. The Pi compartment lid includes a vent for the fan.\n\n\n\n\nThis panel is held in place with magnetic catches and is easy to remove by hand. The front surface features a GPIO reference image that identifies what GPIO references relate to the physical pins on the 40 pin GPIO header.\nScrewless Pi Installation\nThe installation of the Pi is fairly straightforward but younger children will need some assistance. There are three custom white PCBs, two ribbon cables and the SD card adaptor to install. The ribbon cable connectors require some care but overall everything is plug-n-play. The Pi itself is cleverly held in place with magnets.\n\n\n\n\nThis setup is quite nice and avoids the messy cabling seen in other Pi based products.\nThe only issue I had with this setup is that changing the SD cards is fiddly because the fan board needs to be removed or at least loosened first. It’s worth installing both SD cards before you complete the assembly.\nScreen\nThe CrowPi L has a 11.6-inch 1366×768 screen and the brightness can be controlled via the F9 and F10 keys. The viewing angles and colours are fine. Where the screen is a bit of a let down is the clarity of fonts. This may be something that can be improved in software but smaller text lacks the crisp edges of higher resolution screens. Even when the browser is zoomed in some lettering isn’t as clear as I would expect it to be.\nHowever it should be noted that it is easy to plug in an external monitor. For desk based experimenting an additional monitor is always useful and the extra screen space makes programming easier. Even on my Thinkpad or work Elitebook I prefer using external monitors for development tasks.\nBattery & Power\nThe 5000mAh battery can be charged using the USB-C port on the right-hand side.

Obviously this run time would vary depending on use but anything over 3 hours is excellent for this type of device.\nThe power button can be used to power up the Pi but to shutdown the Pi you need to do a software “Shutdown” from within the operating system. Holding down the power button will cut the power without a proper shutdown sequence.\nThe custom image includes a widget in the taskbar that gives an indication of remaining battery charge. It’s a 4 segment battery icon. This is a vital feature for a laptop but I would have liked to see some sort of percentage indicator to get a better idea of remaining charge.\nCooling Fan\nThe GPIO bridge PCB includes a small fan which cools the Pi 4.

It uses a USB dongle and is therefore easy to swap with another model if you want something bigger.\nThe small touch-pad doesn’t look very impressive but was surprisingly usable. Using the mouse is a more practical option but the touch-pad is useful for quick tasks if you don’t have the mouse to hand. Larger touch-pads are available on other laptops but this would have increased the overall size of the CrowPi L.\nDual microSD-card Adapter\nThis adaptor allows you to fit two microSD-cards.\nThe cards can be selected using a simple A-B switch. This allows you to switch between two different operating systems. I placed the CrowPi L image in one slot and a RetroPie card in the other. By using the switch I could use the laptop for programming or games as required.\nThe only real issue with this setup is that replacing the SD cards is quite tricky. To get the cards out you need to partially lift off the GPIO bridge PCB which isn’t easy as it is firmly held in place with 2 banks of 40 pins. It’s a fantastic feature but it works best if you don’t change the cards very often.\nInternal microSD-card Slot\nThere is an additional microSD-card slot that can be used to provide additional storage. It could be used to store code and projects without using the Pi’s main SD card.\nAudio\nThere are two speakers mounted on the rear surface giving the CrowPi L stereo audio capability. The volume can be adjusted from within the OS. As with most laptops you may need full volume in a noisy environment.\n\n\n\n\nThis photo also shows the small feet which lift the CrowPi L off a flat surface. This ensures there is a gap to allow warm air to be ejected from the underside vent.\nCrowtail Starter Kit\nAs well as the CrowPi L I was also sent the “Crowtail Starter Kit”.

    "content:encoded": "\n<p>This guide explains how to disable auto-login on Raspberry Pi OS. By default when you install the Raspberry Pi OS with the desktop it will auto-login when you power-up the Pi. This is really convenient for lots of projects as it gets you straight to the desktop. If you are using your Pi as a desktop computer this starts to become more of a security/privacy risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone breaks into my house and steals my Pi 400 they could power it up elsewhere and potentially run my browser full of saved passwords and bookmarks. Or gain access to any files I had been working on. Hobby projects are of no interest to a thief but personal files, bookmarks, save passwords etc are a bit more of a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I decided it would be best to disable auto-login and require a password when it was booted up.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "This guide explains how to disable auto-login on Raspberry Pi OS. By default when you install the Raspberry Pi OS with the desktop it will auto-login when you power-up the Pi. This is really convenient for lots of projects as it gets you straight to the desktop. If you are using your Pi as a desktop computer this starts to become more of a security/privacy risk.\nIf someone breaks into my house and steals my Pi 400 they could power it up elsewhere and potentially run my browser full of saved passwords and bookmarks. Or gain access to any files I had been working on. Hobby projects are of no interest to a thief but personal files, bookmarks, save passwords etc are a bit more of a problem.\nSo I decided it would be best to disable auto-login and require a password when it was booted up. I only re-boot the Pi 400 every other week so this wasn’t going to be a major inconvenience. That way if someone stole it they would at least be faced with a password.\nBefore proceeding please check that you remember the password to your Pi. Consider changing it now to something sensible and definitely change it if it is still set to the default of “raspberry”.\nSecurity 101\nIf you need to change your password then take a look at the How to Change the Raspberry Pi Password guide.\nTo disable auto-login follow these steps:\nStep 1: Run Raspberry Pi Configuration from the main menu\nClicking on the Raspberry Pi logo in the top-left hand side of the screen will bring up the main menu.\nSelect “Preferences”.\nSelect “Raspberry Pi Configuration”.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Disable Auto-login\nUnder the “System” tab set “Auto Login” to “Disabled”.\nClick “OK”.\n\nStep 3: Reboot Pi for changes to take effect\nFinally you’ll need to reboot the Pi for the changes to take effect.\nYou can do this by:\nClicking on the Raspberry Pi logo in the top-left hand side of the screen will bring up the main menu.\nSelect “Shutdown”.\nSelect “Shutdown” or “Restart”.\n\n\n\n\nIf you selected “Shutdown” you will need to re-apply power to the Pi to reboot.\nYou should now be presented with the username/password login box.\n\nIf you want to re-enable auto-login you can run the Raspberry Pi Configuration utility and set “Auto Login” to “As current user”.\nThe post Disable Auto-login in Raspberry Pi OS appeared first on Raspberry Pi Spy.",
