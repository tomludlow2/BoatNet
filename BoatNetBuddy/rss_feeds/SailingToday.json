There is something for everyone (unless you absolutely require temperatures above 30°C!) and each region stands alone as a fascinating and varied sailing area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Northern France, and the Channel Islands, offer some of the finest sailing waters in Europe. The tides, the weather and navigation are challenging for the inexperienced skipper, but if you like a challenge, the rewards are immense.  The coastline of northern France presents diverse sailing conditions, picturesque landscapes, and a rich maritime heritage, which is why it continues to attract seasoned sailors from around the world.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Brittany-credit-Dream-scaled.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Brittany-credit-Dream-scaled-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Brittany sailing \" class=\"wp-image-31110\" srcset=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Brittany-credit-Dream-scaled-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Brittany-credit-Dream-scaled-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Brittany-credit-Dream-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Brittany-credit-Dream-scaled-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Brittany-credit-Dream-scaled-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Brittany-credit-Dream-scaled-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Brittany-credit-Dream-scaled-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Brittany-credit-Dream-scaled-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Brittany.

The Morbihan inland sea is a fantastic cruising area too, and the region is home to many prehistoric sites, as well as plenty of scenic bays, creeks, and coves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the Straits of Dover, you eventually arrive in Dutch waters, which offers an inland route through the canal system.

Credit: Dream\nLong summer days and sunny, interesting anchorages and marinas await those charter sailors willing to calculate tides and depths and watch the weather forecasts.\nCovering Brittany, the English Channel, the North Sea Coast and the Baltic, the British yachtsman’s almanac covers much of this vast, interesting but challenging sailing area. From tidal extremes off the Brittany coast avoiding some of the busiest shipping lanes on earth and perhaps detouring via the vast Netherlands and Danish inland network you arrive in the relatively placid, rock-strewn waters of the Baltic. There is something for everyone (unless you absolutely require temperatures above 30°C!) and each region stands alone as a fascinating and varied sailing area.\nNorthern France, and the Channel Islands, offer some of the finest sailing waters in Europe. The tides, the weather and navigation are challenging for the inexperienced skipper, but if you like a challenge, the rewards are immense.  The coastline of northern France presents diverse sailing conditions, picturesque landscapes, and a rich maritime heritage, which is why it continues to attract seasoned sailors from around the world.\nBrittany. Credit: Dream\nBrittany is a magnet for British sailors, thanks to its multitude of harbours and anchorages, many of which offer fantastic opportunities ashore to sample the delights of the regional seafood, cider, and crêpes.\nIn southern Brittany, Quiberon Bay is littered with charming places to anchor or tie up on the quayside. The Morbihan inland sea is a fantastic cruising area too, and the region is home to many prehistoric sites, as well as plenty of scenic bays, creeks, and coves.\nThrough the Straits of Dover, you eventually arrive in Dutch waters, which offers an inland route through the canal system. Yachts can motor and sail through villages, towns and cities with the mast upright. Further shortcuts in this region include the Kiel Canal that links the North Sea with the Baltic cutting across the Danish peninsula.\nIf you want to head further north to Scandinavia to experience the spectacular fjords and remote islands of Norway, or the pretty traditional Swedish villages in the south, that is an emerging destination for discerning sailors.\nSweden.

Whether it be racing at one of the iconic regattas in the Caribbean, heading north to the Arctic, south to Antarctic, or on a whisky tour of the west coast of Scotland, there&#8217;s something for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Race Fever</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is, and has always been, possible to charter a yacht for any of the UK&#8217;s large iconic regattas such as Cowes Week, Dartmouth Royal Regatta, Round the Island Race, or the Rolex Fastnet Race, there are now so many more options available for race-hungry sunseekers looking for that ultimate challenge. Take the main Caribbean race season that runs from January to April. Good winds, constant sunshine and crystal clear, warm turquoise water are undoubtedly the Caribbean&#8217;s unique selling points and the reasons why this part of the world is hugely popular for those seeking an exciting winter escape.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings3-scaled.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings3-scaled-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"specialist charter - racing in the Caribbean\" class=\"wp-image-31099\" srcset=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings3-scaled-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings3-scaled-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings3-scaled-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings3-scaled-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings3-scaled-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings3-scaled-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings3-scaled-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Race Chartering.

Antigua Sailing Week, RORC Caribbean 600, Grenada Sailing Week, St Maarten Heineken Regatta, St Barths Bucket, BVI Spring Regatta (British Virgin Islands), St Thomas International Regatta (US Virgin Islands), and Antigua Sailing Week are, without doubt, some of the most popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s not just all about the Caribbean, there are plenty more events around the world to consider such as the Rolex Middle Sea Race (Malta), or the Rolex Sydney Hobart Race, all with charter opportunities.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings4-scaled.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings4-scaled-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"specialist charter - yacht racing\" class=\"wp-image-31098\" srcset=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings4-scaled-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings4-scaled-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings4-scaled-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings4-scaled-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings4-scaled-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings4-scaled-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/credit-the-moorings4-scaled-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">St. Maarten Heineken Regatta &#8211; Specialist charter.

Start your search in the busy sailing centres on the Solent – Hamble, Cowes, Portsmouth and Lymington – to discover your routes into sailing at all the key international regattas, or to organise hospitality, team building, and bespoke sailing days.

It&#8217;s also a great option if you already have experience but are looking to improve your racing skill. Because racing is considered high risk in terms of insurance, there are only a few large companies that offer bareboat charter.

Of course I applaud the ultimate in safety, the RNLI and the SAR heroes who are always there for us when things go wrong, but my philosophy has always been one of taking every precaution to keep Old Man Danger at bay in the first place rather than assuming it’s my right to be saved if my efforts fail. My first priority lies in maintaining the boat as well as I can. Keeping off lee shores is a mantra. Looking after the charts and the paper logbook sorts out the navigation, while understanding my survival options if I find myself offshore in a storm is axiomatic. One policy straight from the gut is always to have a contingency plan up my sleeve where engine failure might result in an emergency, and I always remind people not to fall over the side. We clip on when this is an unavoidable possibility, and wear a lifejacket too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that a radio to call for help is last on my list dates from the days when I crossed oceans with no comms at all. I was alone under God, which led to an innate assumption of self-reliance. This wasn’t because I had special talents; it was just that there was no choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expanding this list would fill a small book so I won’t bore you with any more, but you’ll have noticed that the uppermost thing in my mind as I cast off for a day sail is not to remember to wear my lifejacket.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Crossing the Strait of Gibraltar in a flat-floored yacht with half a gale blowing. Lifer and harness on here today, thank you very much. Credit: Tom Cunliffe\nSafety gear pros and cons can be a chilling subject but it pays to not only be aware of requirements but also understand the consequences of your own actions… \nDating as I do from a different era, I have to say that I’ve never been deeply interested in safety gear. Of course I applaud the ultimate in safety, the RNLI and the SAR heroes who are always there for us when things go wrong, but my philosophy has always been one of taking every precaution to keep Old Man Danger at bay in the first place rather than assuming it’s my right to be saved if my efforts fail. My first priority lies in maintaining the boat as well as I can. Keeping off lee shores is a mantra. Looking after the charts and the paper logbook sorts out the navigation, while understanding my survival options if I find myself offshore in a storm is axiomatic. One policy straight from the gut is always to have a contingency plan up my sleeve where engine failure might result in an emergency, and I always remind people not to fall over the side. We clip on when this is an unavoidable possibility, and wear a lifejacket too. \nThe fact that a radio to call for help is last on my list dates from the days when I crossed oceans with no comms at all. I was alone under God, which led to an innate assumption of self-reliance. This wasn’t because I had special talents; it was just that there was no choice.\nExpanding this list would fill a small book so I won’t bore you with any more, but you’ll have noticed that the uppermost thing in my mind as I cast off for a day sail is not to remember to wear my lifejacket. The truth is that when the weather is fair you could put safe money on it staying in its locker. I do have a self-inflating, up-to-date unit for when conditions demand it. As soon as I start to think, ‘I don’t like the look of this…’ it’s on and fastened, crutch strap and all. After half a century following this procedure I’m still here to tell the tale, so there can’t be a lot wrong with it. \nRelaxed during fair weather in the Baltic.

It’s an expression that can be relevant to pretty much anything though, not just approaching a MOB under sail!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays I spend a lot less time on the water, and a lot more time in the <a href=\"https://www.sailionian.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sail Ionian</a> office replying to guests’ enquiries about charters. Proper planning and research can reap huge rewards during your charter, from boat selection and equipment to itineraries and activities. Preparation is often rushed as a holiday is booked though.

A more pertinent brief would be the number of cabins necessary to keep the crew happy. After the guest accommodation, you should then move quickly on to thinking about yacht size, age, and slab vs in-mast reefing as a bare minimum. Many enquiries I answer at work may just be looking for the best price they can get for a sailing holiday, but I love to get geeky about specifications and equipment. At Sail Ionian, even within the same model, the charter fleet yachts are all slightly different, and it’s fun to match a boat to a particular person. The fleets of one-size-fits-all, plastic decked, basic yachts depress me. I like to look at teak decks, upgraded navigation instruments, lithium batteries and electric outboards. It’s fun to talk boats and I genuinely like to help guide people so that they find the right yacht. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-C38-Aqua-Therapy-sailing-11-scaled.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-C38-Aqua-Therapy-sailing-11-scaled-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"sail ionian charter yacht\" class=\"wp-image-31072\" srcset=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-C38-Aqua-Therapy-sailing-11-scaled-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-C38-Aqua-Therapy-sailing-11-scaled-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-C38-Aqua-Therapy-sailing-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-C38-Aqua-Therapy-sailing-11-scaled-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-C38-Aqua-Therapy-sailing-11-scaled-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-C38-Aqua-Therapy-sailing-11-scaled-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-C38-Aqua-Therapy-sailing-11-scaled-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-C38-Aqua-Therapy-sailing-11-scaled-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Sail Ionian</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>So next time you are planning a holiday ask about the boats in detail. Look at specifications and see what you are really getting for your money. Is the inverter large enough to power a hair dryer? Does the boat have a premium brand anchor with extra-long chain? Are there USB charging ports for your phone in the cabins? Take a bit of time and ask some questions before you pay your deposit – you will soon find the reasons for the differences in price.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mistake 2: Research and route planning</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m as guilty as the next person when it comes to spending enough time planning where to go and what to do during my holidays. Something just always seems to get in the way of doing the research, and I end up in a last-minute rush scrolling through guides at the airport! But it really does make a huge difference to a charter. Ok, you could just book a flotilla and go with the pre-programmed scenery. But take a little time to plan a route properly and you can tailor it to your own preferences and get so much more out of your time abroad. Assuming that you’re talking to a salesperson that actually lives at your destination and not in a call centre, your charter company should be able to help offer advice. Maybe they will even arrange a Zoom call to help speed up the planning. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of your interests, there is a lot of local knowledge that lazy charter companies just won’t take the time to pass on. What about localised wind and weather around the islands, good ports of refuge in case the weather turns interesting, harbours that have easy facilities to re-supply and fill water tanks, which harbours are busier mid-week, anchorages you don’t have to long line in, and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mistake 3: Rushing the boat brief</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rushing through a yacht handover is a cardinal sin in my book. This is how lazy charter companies get away with murder. If a boat brief is rushed, they can gloss over existing problems or pretend that everything was working fine when you picked up the boat. I appreciate it’s hard to give it your full attention when you’ve just arrived after a 6am Gatwick flight, and child number 2 is crying, but you must try. Fight the urge to change out of your jeans into your shorts and set sail, just for a few more moments!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, unlike Sail Ionian, not all companies have yacht manuals on board which explain&nbsp;how all the systems work. So, not only is this your only chance to ask questions about anything complicated that you don’t understand, it’s also your time to take note of anything that you want fixing before you leave. Take photos with your phone so you can refer to them later, or even video the person explaining how something works if you think you’ll forget. Now is also the time to raise any issues with the office, while you can still bring some pressure to bear in person. Don’t just ask the skipper giving you the brief to get something sorted, ask the customer services team too, and tell them you will not be leaving until it’s done.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-33-Calypso-8-scaled.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-33-Calypso-8-scaled-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"sailing yacht at anchor\" class=\"wp-image-31073\" width=\"840\" height=\"472\" srcset=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-33-Calypso-8-scaled-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-33-Calypso-8-scaled-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-33-Calypso-8-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-33-Calypso-8-scaled-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-33-Calypso-8-scaled-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-33-Calypso-8-scaled-696x392.jpg 696w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-33-Calypso-8-scaled-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bavaria-33-Calypso-8-scaled-747x420.jpg 747w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Chartering mistake guide. Credit: Sail Ionian</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I had one disastrous handover as a charter guest on St. Vincent where we were taken out to the boat on a buoy in the middle of the bay by the guy giving us the brief. He tried to pass over so many things; there was a GPS problem, the water tanks were empty, he couldn’t start the outboard and the windlass wasn’t working being the ones I can recall. Stupidly, we sent him off back to shore to get an engineer. Two hours later, we were still on the yacht marooned in the bay, trying to phone the office to ask where he went!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chartering Mistake 4: Not immersing yourself in the local culture</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re a foodie and want to try the local delicacies (lentils and a famous salami for Lefkada, since you ask), visit local vineyards, hike in the hills, or follow in the footsteps of Odysseus, you are chartering for the culture and the place, not just the sailing. Though a lot of guests will come simply to spend time sailing – which is a virtue in itself, to be fair – I do feel they miss out on seeing the islands, as the only time they spend ashore is for dinner each evening. My advice is to focus on something different each time you charter. One week could be about nature and wildlife, the next time could be focused on history and culture. It will give you a different route away from the main shipping lanes and allow you to see different corners of a cruising area.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Number 5: Not getting value for your money</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not enough people ask about all the extras that are available to them. Sail Ionian have a raft of additional services aimed at various needs: from flotillas to free stern to mooring practice, to a day with a skipper, SUP rental, upgraded RIB options, even 220v fan rental!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most charter companies won’t have big mark ups on these add-ons. They are meant to differentiate from the competition and attract business so they’re not usually high value. They can all add huge benefits to a holiday. For example, many of our guests will take the free Med mooring practice session, but not many opt for a day with a skipper. Yes, there’s a charge for the full day, but the value that you get out of that day of mooring and long lining practice, far outweighs an hour of the basics. It can open up a vast number of bays and make it much easier to moor in busy harbours, changing the whole itinerary of not just this charter, but of future ones too. When making a booking, don’t forget to ask what else the company is offering, or if they have anything they recommend that a lot of people opt for.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, if you don’t have the time to prepare fully for a charter, lean on the company you are booking with. They should be very familiar with all the information you need to know and be able to advise in an efficient manner. Just spend a little time at the start of the process to decide what is important to you, what else would be useful, and how you want it to be guided, and then select the best response depending on your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: Alongside watching out for these chartering mistakes, <a href=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/news/sustainable-yacht-charters-finding-responsible-companies/\">check out our guide to finding a sustainably responsible charter company</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-show-me-more\">Show Me More:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/news/italian-charter-guide-cruising-in-italy-sardinia-and-corsica/\">Charter Destination Guide: Cruising in Italy, Sardinia and Corsica</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/news/charter-destination-guide-sailing-croatia-and-montenegro/\">Charter Destination Guide: Sailing Croatia and Montenegro</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/news/american-charter-guide-sailing-in-north-central-and-south-america/\">American Charter Guide: Sailing in North, Central &amp; South America</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/news/five-chartering-mistakes-to-avoid-become-a-yacht-charter-expert/\">Five Chartering Mistakes to Avoid: Become a Yacht Charter Expert</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk\">Sailing Today</a>.</p>\n",

It&#8217;s no surprise considering Greece offers diverse sailing conditions suitable for all skill levels and budgets. Nestled within breathtaking coastlines, with crystal-clear turquoise anchorages, excellent cuisine, and rich cultural heritage, Greece continues to attract generation after generation.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_7549-scaled.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"712\" src=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_7549-scaled-1024x712.jpg\" alt=\"Chartering in Greece\" class=\"wp-image-31084\" srcset=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_7549-scaled-1024x712.jpg 1024w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_7549-scaled-300x208.jpg 300w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_7549-768x534.jpg 768w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_7549-scaled-1536x1067.jpg 1536w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_7549-scaled-2048x1423.jpg 2048w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_7549-100x70.jpg 100w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_7549-scaled-696x484.jpg 696w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_7549-scaled-1068x742.jpg 1068w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_7549-scaled-604x420.jpg 604w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Chartering in Greece.

With around 6,000 <a href=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/news/ionian-hidden-jewels-secret-guide-to-greek-sailing/\">Greek Islands</a> and more than 9,000 miles of coastline, there&#8217;s always somewhere new to visit even for island-hopping regulars, and the industry is so well established in the region that it&#8217;s very well prepared to cater for all types of sailors and their budgets. If you&#8217;re looking for a competitively priced holiday therefore, in a friendly flotilla, a skippered yacht or a bareboat, then Greece will deliver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a sailor&#8217;s perspective, the region is split into six principal areas: the Ionian Sea, the Saronic Gulf, the Cyclades, the Sporades and Dodecanese, the Northern Sporades, and Crete. The Aegean Sea lies to the east of Greece, and the lonian/<a href=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/charter-guide/peloponnese-sailing-in-peaceful-greece/\">Peloponnese</a> to the west.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Giaos-2-credit-sailingholidays-scaled.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"786\" src=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Giaos-2-credit-sailingholidays-scaled-1024x786.jpg\" alt=\"sailing in greece\" class=\"wp-image-31056\" srcset=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Giaos-2-credit-sailingholidays-scaled-1024x786.jpg 1024w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Giaos-2-credit-sailingholidays-scaled-300x230.jpg 300w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Giaos-2-credit-sailingholidays-768x589.jpg 768w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Giaos-2-credit-sailingholidays-scaled-1536x1179.jpg 1536w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Giaos-2-credit-sailingholidays-scaled-2048x1572.jpg 2048w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Giaos-2-credit-sailingholidays-80x60.jpg 80w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Giaos-2-credit-sailingholidays-scaled-696x534.jpg 696w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Giaos-2-credit-sailingholidays-scaled-1068x820.jpg 1068w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Giaos-2-credit-sailingholidays-scaled-547x420.jpg 547w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Chartering in Greece.

So, for relaxed cruising consider the short leg/island-hopping option in areas such as the Ionian, Saronic Gulf and Peloponnese. The islands are just far enough apart to enjoy a good sail, while allowing plenty of time to enjoy the stunning anchorages, beaches and taverna culture. For more of a challenge the Aegean, Dodecanese in the south-east, or even Crete are a good option because the longer passages between the islands &#8211; sometimes 30-40nm &#8211; can take the best part of a day to sail depending on weather conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The weather during May, June, and September is perfect as it&#8217;s typically not excessively hot, the winds remain gentle, and the anchorages are usually less crowded. July and August are the hot months and the winds are more sporadic.

Interestingly, the Island of Corsica is one of the poorest regions of France, reliant on tourism for much of its income, and large stretches of its coastline are undeveloped. Yet just to the south, Sardinia is relatively well off compared to the rest of southern Italy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sardinia&#8217;s Costa Smeralda boasts stunning beaches and crystal-clear waters ideal for relaxation and adventure. The Maddalena Archipelago in particular, on the north-east corner, offers great coastal sailing and scenic anchorages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Corscia-credit-Dream.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Corscia-credit-Dream-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"yacht in anchorage \" class=\"wp-image-31048\" srcset=\"https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Corscia-credit-Dream-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Corscia-credit-Dream-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Corscia-credit-Dream-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Corscia-credit-Dream-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Corscia-credit-Dream-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Corscia-credit-Dream-80x60.jpg 80w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Corscia-credit-Dream-265x198.jpg 265w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Corscia-credit-Dream-696x522.jpg 696w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Corscia-credit-Dream-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://www.sailingtoday.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Corscia-credit-Dream-560x420.jpg 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit:<a href=\"https://www.dreamyachtcharter.com/gb/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Dream</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Corsica offers peace, tranquillity and exciting sailing and you can also be sure of a warm welcome ashore. Nestled between the south of France and Sardinia, this rugged island with its 600-plus miles of coastline, and hundreds of miles of fine white sandy beaches has charter bases in Calvi, Ajaccio, Bonifacio and Macinaggio. The west coast from Cap Corse to Ajaccio is the place to head for. Drop the hook near the Réserve Naturel de Scandola and you may spot seals and dolphins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is now mainland Italy was, until the mid-1800s a series of separate nations, or city states – often at war with each other. This means that the look and feel of the country can change quite dramatically from region to region without travelling huge distances.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tuscan islands of Elba, Capraia, Pianosa, Giglio, and Montecristo are popular destinations for history enthusiasts and wine lovers.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Portofino, Italy. Credit: Sailing Holidays\nHistory and culture combine to make The Tyrrhenian Sea and the Italian coastline one of the most cosmopolitan but charming charter sailing areas on earth.\nItaly boasts many wonderful cruising grounds in a relatively small geographic area, with the Amalfi Coast, Sardinia’s Costa Smeralda, Sicily’s Aeolian Islands and The Tuscan Archipelago just a few of the highlights. Interestingly, the Island of Corsica is one of the poorest regions of France, reliant on tourism for much of its income, and large stretches of its coastline are undeveloped. Yet just to the south, Sardinia is relatively well off compared to the rest of southern Italy.  \nSardinia’s Costa Smeralda boasts stunning beaches and crystal-clear waters ideal for relaxation and adventure. The Maddalena Archipelago in particular, on the north-east corner, offers great coastal sailing and scenic anchorages. \nCredit: Dream\nCorsica offers peace, tranquillity and exciting sailing and you can also be sure of a warm welcome ashore. Nestled between the south of France and Sardinia, this rugged island with its 600-plus miles of coastline, and hundreds of miles of fine white sandy beaches has charter bases in Calvi, Ajaccio, Bonifacio and Macinaggio. The west coast from Cap Corse to Ajaccio is the place to head for. Drop the hook near the Réserve Naturel de Scandola and you may spot seals and dolphins.\nWhat is now mainland Italy was, until the mid-1800s a series of separate nations, or city states – often at war with each other. This means that the look and feel of the country can change quite dramatically from region to region without travelling huge distances. \nThe Tuscan islands of Elba, Capraia, Pianosa, Giglio, and Montecristo are popular destinations for history enthusiasts and wine lovers.
