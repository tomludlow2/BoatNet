We prepared Zen Again by changing from a 16kg to a 20kg Manson Supreme anchor, 8mm to 10mm anchor chain, rewiring the mast, a new Tasker mainsail, a Tides Marine Sailtrack and a new Pelagic autopilot, some of which is will be in Yachting Monthly’s February 2025 edition. After several years in the tropics we prepared ourselves with warm clothes and new wet weather gear.</p>\n<p>We had a wonderful cruise through New England to Nova Scotia and southern Newfoundland. Our overall goal was to transit the Panama Canal in 2025 so we had two alternatives: Plan A returned coastwise via the US, Bahamas and Caribbean; and Plan B was a clockwise North Atlantic circuit via Azores, Canaries and Caribbean.</p>\n<p>Plan A was conventional but against prevailing winds and potentially hiding from hurricanes. Plan B was longer but rode the prevailing winds. We’d only briefly visited the Azores en route from Australia to Europe and hoped to cruise them more fully. We opted for Plan B.</p>\n<p>We timed our cruise down east to suit our expected St Pierre departure date of early August. This put us ahead of many cruisers, except only those few planning long cruises in Nova Scotia or Newfoundland, or bound towards Greenland, Iceland and beyond. We found many US coastal resorts were opening ‘next week’ as we cruised east over several months.</p>\n<h2>Sailing in the Atlantic: Route options</h2>\n<p>A summer passage from St Pierre to Flores involves three distinct parts – Grand Banks, Gulf Stream and Azores High. The Grand Banks offer cold shallow water, fog and usually SW winds.</p>\n<p>The Gulf Stream offers deep warm water, strong but varying currents and thunderstorms. The Azores High offers warmth, sunny skies and lighter winds, with a high risk of calms if the high is over the Azores. The passage is 1,200 miles, so about 10 days for us.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100595\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100595\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100595\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM311.skills_lc_Azores.02_MikeReynolds1_Mike_Reynolds-630x354.png\" alt=\"Mike Reynolds on board in cloudy weather\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM311.skills_lc_Azores.02_MikeReynolds1_Mike_Reynolds-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM311.skills_lc_Azores.02_MikeReynolds1_Mike_Reynolds-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM311.skills_lc_Azores.02_MikeReynolds1_Mike_Reynolds-768x432.png 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM311.skills_lc_Azores.02_MikeReynolds1_Mike_Reynolds-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM311.skills_lc_Azores.02_MikeReynolds1_Mike_Reynolds.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100595\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mike Reynolds is an electronics engineer who lectures on yacht navigation and communications systems.</p></div>\n<p>The key risks are gales at the start of the passage, calms at the end and hurricanes throughout. Initial gales and hurricanes are easily avoided with modern weather forecasting – hide and wait for them to pass. The tricky part is avoiding calms since 10-day forecasts are unreliable.</p>\n<p>We had timed our cruise down east to St Pierre to arrive there mid-summer. At that time hurricanes sometimes track up the US coast to Canada and out into the North Atlantic, generally decaying as they recurve east. We hoped for an ex-hurricane to pass well north of us as we crossed the Gulf Stream. It would push the Azores High south, giving us westerlies for the last part of the passage.</p>\n<p>In Newfoundland we were following the weather outlook closely. We timed our passage to St Pierre as a hurricane was approaching the Caribbean and curving north. In St Pierre we compared notes with two other cruisers. One departed two days before us and the other one day before us. The former was a big cat and the latter a 38ft monohull.</p>\n<p>The now ex-hurricane was predicted to pass well to our north in a week. An excellent weather window seemed to be in place.</p>\n<p>In the run up to departure and throughout the passage we twice daily downloaded routes plus ECMWF and GFS wind, gust, CAPE, rain, cloud, pressure, air temperature and wave GRIB files from PredictWind. Separately we downloaded RTOFS ocean surface current GRIB files from SailDocs.</p>\n<p>While in range of weather radar we viewed this live, high-resolution information from Windy. All were downloaded using our Gen2 Starlink which we’ve been using for more than two years.</p>\n<p><em>Article continues below&#8230;</em></p>\n\n\n<div id=\"accordion\" class=\"collection-wrapper list-large \">\n\n\t\t\t\t<article class=\"loop loop-list-large row post-99013 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-cruising-life tag-learning-curve tag-top-story publication_name-yachting-monthly loop-first loop-odd loop-1 featured-image\" role=\"article\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 entry-media\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/cruising-life/never-before-have-i-sailed-in-such-wild-weather-struck-by-a-weather-bomb-near-new-zealand-99013\" rel=\"bookmark\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/09/YAM304.skills_lc_NZ_tonga.28_TB7HNP_Alamy.jpg\" class=\"attachment-square size-square wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/09/YAM304.skills_lc_NZ_tonga.28_TB7HNP_Alamy.jpg 2000w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/09/YAM304.skills_lc_NZ_tonga.28_TB7HNP_Alamy-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/09/YAM304.skills_lc_NZ_tonga.28_TB7HNP_Alamy-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/09/YAM304.skills_lc_NZ_tonga.28_TB7HNP_Alamy-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/09/YAM304.skills_lc_NZ_tonga.28_TB7HNP_Alamy-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" data-image-id=\"99022\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/cruising-life/never-before-have-i-sailed-in-such-wild-weather-struck-by-a-weather-bomb-near-new-zealand-99013\" rel=\"bookmark\">‘Never before have I sailed in such wild  weather’ – struck by a &#8216;weather bomb&#8217; near New Zealand</a></h2>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</header>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\n                            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Sammy, my sister, was ready to go.

We had squalls with winds gusting to 25 knots. The seas were short and lumpy. Once in a while a sea would break into us, giving us a good side swipe with green water over the deck and drenching the cockpit.</p>\n<h2>Sailing through the mizzle</h2>\n<p>The start set the scene for the next three days. Winds stayed SW, mostly 18 gusting 25 knots, but with occasional squalls to 30. The fog persisted. Sailing through the fog at night was interesting.</p>\n<p>There was ‘mizzle’ in the air which landed on all windward surfaces. That included the crew if we emerged from shelter. It would have been miserable if we were broad reaching. Thankfully the mizzle stopped during the day. We used the autopilot since we were pushing fairly hard with more mainsail than our WindPilot vane gear could handle.</p>\n<p>During the nights the fog broke up at times. We could then see a few stars through holes in the higher clouds. We had varying reefs in the main and furls in the yankee.

This was in addition to AIS since so many fishing vessels don’t transmit on AIS. We also chose to keep our dinghy inflated on deck. It was very well lashed down but supplemented our life raft.</p>\n<p>Our SailnSea SailingGen hydro-generator kept our batteries charged while the solar panels struggled to function with little sunlight.</p>\n<h2>Gulf Stream</h2>\n<p>On day four the fog lifted and we moved off soundings into the Gulf Stream. The wind eased until eventually the sails were slatting and we started motoring. Some hours later we resumed sailing as a nice WSW breeze came in.</p>\n<p>A thunderstorm gradually built to windward and the wind backed to the SSW. We furled the yankee and unrolled the staysail. It was a good decision as we had gusts to 36 knots. Zen Again was very comfortable under double-reefed main and staysail as the thunderstorm dumped a lot of rain on us.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100594\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100594\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100594\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM311.skills_lc_Azores.01_IMG_3527_Mike_Reynolds-630x354.png\" alt=\"Dawn rises over the Gulf Stream during the middle section of the voyage, which fell into three parts\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM311.skills_lc_Azores.01_IMG_3527_Mike_Reynolds-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM311.skills_lc_Azores.01_IMG_3527_Mike_Reynolds-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM311.skills_lc_Azores.01_IMG_3527_Mike_Reynolds-768x432.png 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM311.skills_lc_Azores.01_IMG_3527_Mike_Reynolds-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM311.skills_lc_Azores.01_IMG_3527_Mike_Reynolds.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100594\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dawn rises over the Gulf Stream during the middle section of the voyage, which fell into three parts</p></div>\n<p>This set the pattern for the Gulf Stream transit. Thunderstorms were passing by or building around us with little wind between them. The name of the game was to avoid both the calms and the storms themselves. Currents were generally with us but not consistently. Their presence was obvious from the sea state.</p>\n<p>We spent several days crossing this area. We used both autopilot and vane gear depending on conditions.</p>\n<p>The deep low was now passing well clear to our north and tracking east as predicted. The Azores High was being pushed south nicely, and our morale improved with every degree the temperature rose.</p>\n<h2>Azores High</h2>\n<p>Champagne sailing officially commenced on the afternoon of day eight. We had left the thunderstorms astern and were riding the Azores High. Seas of only one metre and broad reaching in 10 gusting 15 knots. Bright sunny days.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Fog, currents and calms would challenge Mike Reynolds as he tackled the Grand Banks, Gulf Stream and Azores High. He was at the French island of St Pierre off the Newfoundland coast, next stop was sailing in the Atlantic to Flores in the Azores.\n\nZen Again, our Japanese designed and built 1980s IOR ¾ tonner, is a well-equipped ‘pocket’ blue-water cruiser. She has over 50,000 miles under her keel with us and about twice that with previous owners. The original Japanese owners circumnavigated South America from Japan.\nThe second Japanese owner did a single-handed partial circumnavigation of the Pacific, finishing in Australia. We purchased her at home in Australia and have spent the last 10 years slowly circumnavigating.\n\nAlongside before\ndeparture, with the new 20kg Manson Supreme anchor and the dinghy lashed on deck\n\nWe started the season on the hard in Deltaville on Chesapeake Bay in the US. We prepared Zen Again by changing from a 16kg to a 20kg Manson Supreme anchor, 8mm to 10mm anchor chain, rewiring the mast, a new Tasker mainsail, a Tides Marine Sailtrack and a new Pelagic autopilot, some of which is will be in Yachting Monthly’s February 2025 edition. After several years in the tropics we prepared ourselves with warm clothes and new wet weather gear.\nWe had a wonderful cruise through New England to Nova Scotia and southern Newfoundland. Our overall goal was to transit the Panama Canal in 2025 so we had two alternatives: Plan A returned coastwise via the US, Bahamas and Caribbean; and Plan B was a clockwise North Atlantic circuit via Azores, Canaries and Caribbean.\nPlan A was conventional but against prevailing winds and potentially hiding from hurricanes. Plan B was longer but rode the prevailing winds. We’d only briefly visited the Azores en route from Australia to Europe and hoped to cruise them more fully. We opted for Plan B.\nWe timed our cruise down east to suit our expected St Pierre departure date of early August. This put us ahead of many cruisers, except only those few planning long cruises in Nova Scotia or Newfoundland, or bound towards Greenland, Iceland and beyond. We found many US coastal resorts were opening ‘next week’ as we cruised east over several months.\nSailing in the Atlantic: Route options\nA summer passage from St Pierre to Flores involves three distinct parts – Grand Banks, Gulf Stream and Azores High. The Grand Banks offer cold shallow water, fog and usually SW winds.\nThe Gulf Stream offers deep warm water, strong but varying currents and thunderstorms. The Azores High offers warmth, sunny skies and lighter winds, with a high risk of calms if the high is over the Azores. The passage is 1,200 miles, so about 10 days for us.\n\nMike Reynolds is an electronics engineer who lectures on yacht navigation and communications systems.\n\nThe key risks are gales at the start of the passage, calms at the end and hurricanes throughout. Initial gales and hurricanes are easily avoided with modern weather forecasting – hide and wait for them to pass. The tricky part is avoiding calms since 10-day forecasts are unreliable.\nWe had timed our cruise down east to St Pierre to arrive there mid-summer. At that time hurricanes sometimes track up the US coast to Canada and out into the North Atlantic, generally decaying as they recurve east. We hoped for an ex-hurricane to pass well north of us as we crossed the Gulf Stream. It would push the Azores High south, giving us westerlies for the last part of the passage.\nIn Newfoundland we were following the weather outlook closely. We timed our passage to St Pierre as a hurricane was approaching the Caribbean and curving north. In St Pierre we compared notes with two other cruisers. One departed two days before us and the other one day before us. The former was a big cat and the latter a 38ft monohull.\nThe now ex-hurricane was predicted to pass well to our north in a week. An excellent weather window seemed to be in place.\nIn the run up to departure and throughout the passage we twice daily downloaded routes plus ECMWF and GFS wind, gust, CAPE, rain, cloud, pressure, air temperature and wave GRIB files from PredictWind. Separately we downloaded RTOFS ocean surface current GRIB files from SailDocs.\nWhile in range of weather radar we viewed this live, high-resolution information from Windy. All were downloaded using our Gen2 Starlink which we’ve been using for more than two years.\nArticle continues below…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n‘Never before have I sailed in such wild  weather’ – struck by a ‘weather bomb’ near New Zealand\nSammy, my sister, was ready to go. She couldn’t wait to put on her skipper’s hat and head off on…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n‘Crocodiles, sharks, box jellyfish, stonefish and sea-snakes’ – Sailing the northern Australian coast\nThe Kimberly Coast of Northern Australia has the largest tidal range in the southern hemisphere. In Derby, to the west…\n\n\nGrand Banks\nWe departed St Pierre at noon in thick fog and light winds. As we cleared the lee of the island the wind slowly filled in and we shut down the engine. We close-reached SE through thick fog in gradually increasing wind, reducing sail in stages.\n\nA padded onesie thermal suit kept Nikki warm under her waterproofs\n\nBy morning the wind had veered to the SW giving us a beam reach. We had squalls with winds gusting to 25 knots. The seas were short and lumpy. Once in a while a sea would break into us, giving us a good side swipe with green water over the deck and drenching the cockpit.\nSailing through the mizzle\nThe start set the scene for the next three days. Winds stayed SW, mostly 18 gusting 25 knots, but with occasional squalls to 30. The fog persisted. Sailing through the fog at night was interesting.\nThere was ‘mizzle’ in the air which landed on all windward surfaces. That included the crew if we emerged from shelter. It would have been miserable if we were broad reaching. Thankfully the mizzle stopped during the day. We used the autopilot since we were pushing fairly hard with more mainsail than our WindPilot vane gear could handle.\nDuring the nights the fog broke up at times. We could then see a few stars through holes in the higher clouds. We had varying reefs in the main and furls in the yankee. It was cold and we were loving our padded onesies and new wet weather gear!\n\nDawn under the clear skies of the Azores High\n\nTwice a large pod of dolphins accompanied us for about 30 minutes – always a morale booster, which was welcome amid the tough sailing, though we were motivated by the thought we were heading for the sun!\nThroughout this part of the passage we used our radar continuously. This was in addition to AIS since so many fishing vessels don’t transmit on AIS. We also chose to keep our dinghy inflated on deck. It was very well lashed down but supplemented our life raft.\nOur SailnSea SailingGen hydro-generator kept our batteries charged while the solar panels struggled to function with little sunlight.\nGulf Stream\nOn day four the fog lifted and we moved off soundings into the Gulf Stream. The wind eased until eventually the sails were slatting and we started motoring. Some hours later we resumed sailing as a nice WSW breeze came in.\nA thunderstorm gradually built to windward and the wind backed to the SSW. We furled the yankee and unrolled the staysail. It was a good decision as we had gusts to 36 knots. Zen Again was very comfortable under double-reefed main and staysail as the thunderstorm dumped a lot of rain on us.\n\nDawn rises over the Gulf Stream during the middle section of the voyage, which fell into three parts\n\nThis set the pattern for the Gulf Stream transit. Thunderstorms were passing by or building around us with little wind between them. The name of the game was to avoid both the calms and the storms themselves. Currents were generally with us but not consistently. Their presence was obvious from the sea state.\nWe spent several days crossing this area. We used both autopilot and vane gear depending on conditions.\nThe deep low was now passing well clear to our north and tracking east as predicted. The Azores High was being pushed south nicely, and our morale improved with every degree the temperature rose.\nAzores High\nChampagne sailing officially commenced on the afternoon of day eight. We had left the thunderstorms astern and were riding the Azores High. Seas of only one metre and broad reaching in 10 gusting 15 knots. Bright sunny days. Nights with a wonderful half moon followed by a spectacular view of the Milky Way.\nWith the wind now well aft we adopted our ‘trade-wind sailing’ mode. We broad reach under windvane steering gear with boom brake set and gybe our way downwind. Better VMG (velocity made good), less rolling, much safer. It was great to escape the cold and fog into warmth and sun.\nAs we approached Flores another yacht appeared on AIS off our beam. It was the larger monohull which had departed St Pierre a day before us. Nice!\nThe persistent fog, lumpy sea state and plenty of wind over the Grand Banks kept us on our toes. Poor visibility certainly adds an ‘edge’ when sailing fast. The Gulf Stream was challenging navigating around the thunderstorms while trying to stay in positive current. The Azores High was the reward with beautiful tradewinds-style sailing.\nIn hindsight the scariest part of the passage was anticipating it. As we cruised Canada we were the only boat we came across planning to sail to the Azores. It seemed we were ‘taking a flyer’ on our own. But we’d done the research and were sure we just needed to wait for a good weather window.\n\nMike relishes warm air and gentle sailing conditions\n\nArriving in St Pierre and discovering others planning the same passage was encouraging. And a weather window arrived right on time.\nThe passage took 10 days, as hoped, and we logged 1,200 miles for an average boat speed of 5 knots, with about 50 miles of current assistance. Maximum wind speed was 36 knots with seas to 2m and swell to 2.5m. We motored for 37 hours, almost all in the Gulf Stream.\nFailures included an autopilot actuator and a new leak into the forepeak.

And one of the most important things any sailor or boater can own is an inflatable PFD. But how to pick the best lifejacket?</p>\n<p>All of the best inflatable lifejackets for boaters conform to a set of minimum ISO standards and are USCG approved, but how do you know which one is actually the best for your personal use and body type? Well, I and a few of my professional sailing colleagues went ahead and threw ourselves into a sea survival day of inflatable lifejacket and PFD testing. Not all inflatable lifejackets are the same, just as not all body shapes are the same.</p>\n<h2>How to choose the best inflatable lifejacket or PFD?</h2>\n<p>From their basic ISO rated start point, all inflatable lifejackets take on their own characteristics and design elements. The positioning of the CO2 inflation bottle, the shape of the bladder, the position of the crotch strap and the way it is attached, the location of the whistle, the position of the oral inflation tube and the location of the lifting strop. Some of our PFD&#8217;s and lifejackets on test also have sprayhoods and water activated strobe lights.</p>\n<p>I comprehensively put these inflatable lifejackets through sea survival drills and shoreside scrutiny.

It has excellent elevated lighting and reflective visibility, good snug fit holding the user high in the water and good sprayhood. The harness release system is another good feature.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Things to consider:</strong> The bladder is a darker orange and may not be as visible as some of the brighter bladders available. The extra sculpting can make the lifejacket feel a bit stiff to wear and makes it heavy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Verdict:</strong> This is an outstanding lifejacket with great performance across the score board. The standout features are the lighting, both elevated and lume-on, lighting the entire bladder. The essentials are labelled and easy to find and this feels like a lifejacket that has really been designed with the user in mind. Every query has been answered.

It doesn&#8217;t shout look at me, which I suspect will have as many nods of approval as there will be shrugs of where&#8217;s the pizzazz?</p>\n<p>It has a smooth contoured shape to fit the body and once it’s on you can easily forget you’re wearing it. The back section is cut low and doesn&#8217;t impede on a collar or the back of your neck.</p>\n<p>The weight is also distributed nicely across the whole body so there’s no hot spots. I tried this on over the top of a T-shirt and then later with a lightweight foul weather jacket and both options were comfortable.  The quick adjust side buckles are a familiar premium feature and the tail end excess is dealt with neatly with velcro loops.</p>\n<p>Where the lifejacket really shines though is when it is deployed as an inflated bladder.<br />\nThe shape is really unlike all other lifejackets currently available. The bladder at the front is more pointed or conical, with additional wave baffles built into it. This acts doubly to make waves pass around you and those that hit directly are baffled by the webs. There’s an additional little “pillow” to raise your head further still and this gives a feeling of really being raised out of the water.</p>\n<p>The sprayhood has a pram-style arch support which keeps it from collapsing on your head and keeps the plastic away from your face. It also makes it very easy to deploy and pull forward.  Two loops pull down and go over each bladder end.</p>\n<p>They’ve thought about emergency beacon positioning too, though these were still being certified for use at the time of testing. There’s a dedicated area for a personal locator beacon or personal AIS beacon to attach to on the right-hand lower bladder section which is unencumbered by the sprayhood.</p>\n<p>In the water I was able to scull backwards and maneuver really easily as there was plenty of room for arm articulation.<br />\nI strongly believe that all other lifejacket manufacturers are going to have to up their game in terms of bladder design. The Mustang Atlas 190 DLX has set the bar very high indeed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mustang-survival.co.uk/products/atlas-190-dlx-pro-sensor-life-jacket-md3185e1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Buy it now</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youboatmarine.com/mustang-survival-atlas190-dxl-pro-lifejacket.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Buy it now from YouBoat</a></p>\n<hr />\n<h6 style=\"text-align: left;\">Note: We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site, at no extra cost to you.

It also comes in a range of specification levels to suit individual needs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Reasons to Avoid:</strong> This test model version comes without a sprayhood or light which would be essential for any offshore or coastal use after dark. Make sure you opt for the higher spec model.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Verdict:</strong> This is without doubt a highly capable lifejacket. It fits well both shoreside and in the water. The extra buoyancy is noticeable in the longer bladder. We were unable to test the fully fledged offshore equipped lifejacket and if this lifejacket suits you, then make sure you opt for that extra specification.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a style=\"color: #ff0000;\" href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/reviews/review/baltic-force-190n-lifejacket-tested\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read the full Baltic Force review</a></span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1652261&amp;xcust=yachtingmonthly_gb_6876689188003915000&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tradeinn.com%2Fwaveinn%2Fen%2Fbaltic-force-190-inflatable-lifejacket%2F138264018%2Fp&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yachtingmonthly.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Buy Baltic Force from tradeinn.com</a></strong></p>\n<hr />\n<div id=\"attachment_85948\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-85948\" class=\"size-full wp-image-85948\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2022/04/seago-3dynamic-tony.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2022/04/seago-3dynamic-tony.jpg 400w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2022/04/seago-3dynamic-tony-125x200.jpg 125w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2022/04/seago-3dynamic-tony-250x400.jpg 250w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2022/04/seago-3dynamic-tony-313x500.jpg 313w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-85948\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Toni wearing Seago 3Dynamic 190N lifejacket</p></div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/reviews/gear-reviews/seago-3dynamic-lifejacket-tested\"><strong>Seago 3Dynamic Automatic inflatable lifejacket PFD</strong></a></h2>\n<p><strong>Specifications: </strong>Chest size: 55 to 140cm, Buoyancy: 300N, Colour: Carbon/black, <span class=\"a-size-large product-title-word-break\">Features: Double crutch strap, pro sensor firing head, neoprene collar, </span><span class=\"a-size-large product-title-word-break\">harness included</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong> This lifejacket looks smart and generally well sculpted to form fit.

The crossover bladder is a good design to stop waves funneling into the face, but we would advise to upgrade the sprayhood and light position to have a better in-water performance should you ever need it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em><a style=\"color: #ff0000;\" href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/reviews/gear-reviews/ocean-safety-sport-pro-adv-lifejacket-tested\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read the full Ocean Safety Sport Pro review</a></em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b><a href=\"https://marinestore.co.uk/ocean-safety-kru-sport-pro-adv-lifejacket-carbon-red-lif7313.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Buy Ocean Safety Sport Pro 170N ADV from marinestore.com</a></b></p>\n<hr />\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-96415\" style=\"font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400;\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2023/09/20220511_203256-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"420\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2023/09/20220511_203256-1.jpg 420w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2023/09/20220511_203256-1-131x200.jpg 131w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2023/09/20220511_203256-1-263x400.jpg 263w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2023/09/20220511_203256-1-328x500.jpg 328w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px\" /></h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Spinlock Vito 170N Hammar automatic inflatable lifejacket</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Specifications: </strong>Buoyancy: 170N, <span class=\"a-size-large product-title-word-break\">Features: Pylon Lifejacket Light<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />, Lume-On<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />, Toggle attachment point for optional Chest Pack (DW-PCC)</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong> One of the best sprayhoods we&#8217;ve tested, low profile lifejacket casing, Hammar trigger means you can use this in wild sailing conditions without accidental triggering.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Reasons to Avoid: </strong>Hammar trigger means re-arming this is a faff.

The Hammar trigger mechanism is a matter for you to decide if it&#8217;s right for you. They do sell the Vito with the pro sensor trigger too. The over the head donning is a love it or loathe it style and whilst it can feel very secure and the harness loop is excellent, passing this over your head, large collar and other foulies in a rush can feel a bit claustrophobic. The back is low cut though and the sprayhood is stowed in a back panel keeping the bulk away from the collar area. It is an excellent lifejacket and has scored highly in our early test scores.

The bladder is significantly larger and provides a much greater buoyancy and visibility. It is large though, so we don&#8217;t recommend this for day to day sailing. The weight of the lifejacket comes in at 1529grams, which is 200g more than the standard 170N deckvest. This might not seem a great deal but over the course of a day, wearing this might be quite fatiguing. Of course, if you are wearing a large immersion suit or other bulky clothes or dry suit for use in deep ocean conditions, you will be very glad of the extra this lifejacket offers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://www.piratescave.co.uk/spinlock-deckvest-6d-275n-automatic-life-jacket.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><b> Buy Spinlock Deckvest 6D 275N from piratescave.co.uk</b></a></p>\n<hr />\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-100514 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/06/20240131_125904-scaled-e1739735892249-557x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"557\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/06/20240131_125904-scaled-e1739735892249-557x400.jpg 557w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/06/20240131_125904-scaled-e1739735892249-278x200.jpg 278w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/06/20240131_125904-scaled-e1739735892249-768x552.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/06/20240131_125904-scaled-e1739735892249-1536x1103.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/06/20240131_125904-scaled-e1739735892249-630x452.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/06/20240131_125904-scaled-e1739735892249.jpg 1604w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px\" /></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">TeamO Backtow 275N inflatable lifejacket</h2>\n<p><strong>Specifications: </strong>Buoyancy: 275N,<span class=\"a-size-large product-title-word-break\"> Features: </span>Pro sensor automatic inflation, backtow harness system</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong> It has a larger capacity bladder for superior righting and buoyancy.

It might impede access to liferaft if you are a smaller person.</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict: </strong>This is a larger capacity lifejacket and really, it&#8217;s just a larger version of the highly rated and well respected original Backtow lifejacket.<br />\nAs such, it doesn&#8217;t carry any more bells or whistles that that one and on this model, it had a light and sprayhood as standard, though the lifejacket hasn&#8217;t been modified especially to counter the larger bladder size. This makes it rather bulky for boarding a liferaft and the sprayhood when we tested it in the pool, when flipped back to allow better articulation for boarding the liferaft, it filled with water and carried a few litres into the liferaft with our test subject. But the lifejacket does give the wearer a considerable additional freeboard. The payoff for the extra buoyancy is the extra bulk and weight when moving around onboard during day to day use. Bigger isn&#8217;t necessarily always better, so if you can, do try one on before you buy.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.teamomarine.com/products/ocean-275n-backtow-lifejacket?srsltid=AfmBOopzAQWjN3Cwq_J3ULtdp6CA7MlQcAIVPzpwfPGP-BsCoeOFjUvC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buy it Now</a></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Coastal Lifejackets 150-180N</h2>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">The best inflatable lifejackets for boaters and sailors who sail coastal waters and ride in ribs, tenders and dinghies</h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-100511\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/06/20240906_132614-533x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"533\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/06/20240906_132614-533x400.jpg 533w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/06/20240906_132614-267x200.jpg 267w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/06/20240906_132614-135x100.jpg 135w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/06/20240906_132614-768x576.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/06/20240906_132614-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/06/20240906_132614-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/06/20240906_132614-630x473.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px\" /></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Baltic Epiq 165N Auto Inflatable Lifejacket Aqua Blue 40-150kg</h2>\n<p><strong>Specifications: </strong>Size: Adult (one size) Buoyancy, 165N,  5-Year warranty, Made from partially recycled materials, Manufactured in Europe</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong> Lightweight and flexible, it forms to your body shape easily.

Where it excels is as a lifejacket in the water, and that&#8217;s where it really counts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em><a style=\"color: #ff0000;\" href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/reviews/gear-reviews/seago-seaguard-lifejacket-tested\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read the full Seago Seaguard review</a></em></span></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.piratescave.co.uk/seago-seaguard-165-life-jacket.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Buy Seago Seaguard from Pirates Cave</a></strong></p>\n<hr />\n<div id=\"attachment_86003\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86003\" class=\"size-full wp-image-86003\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2022/04/3T1A5669.jpg\" alt=\"Crewsaver Crewfit+ 180 Pro checking adjustment\" width=\"400\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2022/04/3T1A5669.jpg 400w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2022/04/3T1A5669-125x200.jpg 125w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2022/04/3T1A5669-250x400.jpg 250w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2022/04/3T1A5669-313x500.jpg 313w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-86003\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">checking adjustment</p></div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/reviews/gear-reviews/crewsaver-crewfit-pro-lifejacket-tested\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Crewsaver Crewfit+ 180N pro inflatable lifejacket PFD</strong></a></h2>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><em>&#8220;best premium coastal lifejacket&#8221;</em></strong></h4>\n<p><strong>Specifications: </strong> Size: Adult (one size), Buoyancy: 180N,  Colour: <span id=\"productTitle\" class=\"a-size-large product-title-word-break\">Black,</span><span id=\"productTitle\" class=\"a-size-large product-title-word-break\">  Features: Soft loop D-ring for attaching harness</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong> It&#8217;s a smart black lifejacket that will blend in with any outfit.

It was very difficult for the tester to get onto their front to begin the test at all, and they spun over in close to one second. The Crewsaver Ergofit+ 190N also produced the best freeboard figures with up to 4cm more than some of the other lifejackets.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/CREWSAVER-ErgoFit-190N-Offshore-LIFEJACKET-FREE-UK-Mainland-Delivery/263532847620?mkevt=1&amp;mkcid=1&amp;mkrid=710-53481-19255-0&amp;campid=5337827784&amp;customid=yachtingmonthly-gb-9069522391828785000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Buy it now on eBay (marinesuperstore)</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1652261&amp;xcust=yachtingmonthly_gb_3897559676156286500&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gaelforcemarine.co.uk%2Fen%2FCrewsaver-Ergofit-190N-Automatic-Harness-Lifejacket-with-Light-and-Hood%2Fm-7442.aspx&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yachtingmonthly.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Buy it now from Gael Force Marine</a></strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-73344 size-full\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2020/08/ed072_Lifejackets_Helly_Hansen_1D5A0618_314497462_537208122.jpg\" alt=\"Helly Hansen Sailsafe Race 170 Auto best lifejackets\" width=\"630\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2020/08/ed072_Lifejackets_Helly_Hansen_1D5A0618_314497462_537208122.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2020/08/ed072_Lifejackets_Helly_Hansen_1D5A0618_314497462_537208122-300x190.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /></p>\n<h3>Helly Hansen Sailsafe Race 170 Auto lifejacket</h3>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/reviews/review/helly-hansen-sailsafe-race-170-auto-lifejacket-reviewed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Read the full review of the Helly Hansen Sailsafe Race</a></h4>\n<p><strong>Specifications:</strong> Buoyancy: ‎170N,<span class=\"a-size-large product-title-word-break\"> Features: </span>Hammar Hydrostatic pressure automatic inflation sensor, SOLAS approved Reflective elements, 5000N reinforced grab loop</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong> The hammar has an auto activation function and is fast to inflate.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons to Avoid:</strong> The thigh straps might not be for everyone and its buckles slip too easily.</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Hammar inflation and an inspection window make checking and maintaining the lifejacket simple.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "I took a group of maritime professionals, sailors and sea survival experts and together we tested 22 of the best inflatable lifejackets and PFDs on the market. I bring you the real world results of what they're like to use, both in and out of the water.  \n\nWith over 3.5 million people in the US alone participating in sailing each year, that’s a lot of opportunity for all kinds of unintended swimming, or unplanned early dismounting from our boats. And one of the most important things any sailor or boater can own is an inflatable PFD. But how to pick the best lifejacket?\nAll of the best inflatable lifejackets for boaters conform to a set of minimum ISO standards and are USCG approved, but how do you know which one is actually the best for your personal use and body type? Well, I and a few of my professional sailing colleagues went ahead and threw ourselves into a sea survival day of inflatable lifejacket and PFD testing. Not all inflatable lifejackets are the same, just as not all body shapes are the same.\nHow to choose the best inflatable lifejacket or PFD?\nFrom their basic ISO rated start point, all inflatable lifejackets take on their own characteristics and design elements. The positioning of the CO2 inflation bottle, the shape of the bladder, the position of the crotch strap and the way it is attached, the location of the whistle, the position of the oral inflation tube and the location of the lifting strop. Some of our PFD’s and lifejackets on test also have sprayhoods and water activated strobe lights.\nI comprehensively put these inflatable lifejackets through sea survival drills and shoreside scrutiny. To learn more about what the team tested and how we did it, go to the bottom of this buyers guide to see our crew doing their thing, getting hands on with all of these PFDs..\nEach inflatable lifejacket has its own review page. If you want a more in-depth PFD review, simply click through to read more.\nA note from the Tech Editor: Fox Morgan\n\nThe best lifejacket is the one you wear. (especially if it allows for onboard snacks) \nEditors choices : At a glance\n\n \n\nBaltic Athena Auto Inflatable Lifejacket – Best women’s specific lifejacket – Buy Now\nSeago Seaguard 165N – Best budget friendly lifejacket – Buy Now\nCrewsaver Crewfit+ 180N pro – Best premium costal lifejacket– Buy Now\nSpinlock 6D Deckveset – Best offshore lifejacket\nOffshore Lifejackets 190N\nThe best inflatable lifejackets  and PFDs for boaters and sailors\n\nSpinlock Deckvest 6D 170N Automatic Inflatable lifejacket / PFD\nHighly Commended Best all round\nSpecifications: Buoyancy: 170N or 275N, Colour: Black, pacific blue, tropic white, citrus yellow, black with HRS, pacific blue with HRS, tropic white with HRS and citrus yellow with HRS, Features:170N autoinflation, harness release system, crotch strap, sprayhood, lumeon bladder illumination, automatic strobe light,  adjustable body height\nWhat I love about it: Its form-fitting sculpted design and bright colour of casing make this a stylish lifejacket. It has excellent elevated lighting and reflective visibility, good snug fit holding the user high in the water and good sprayhood. The harness release system is another good feature.\nThings to consider: The bladder is a darker orange and may not be as visible as some of the brighter bladders available. The extra sculpting can make the lifejacket feel a bit stiff to wear and makes it heavy.\nVerdict: This is an outstanding lifejacket with great performance across the score board. The standout features are the lighting, both elevated and lume-on, lighting the entire bladder. The essentials are labelled and easy to find and this feels like a lifejacket that has really been designed with the user in mind. Every query has been answered. If we were challenged to find a way to improve this, we’re really not sure how we would.\nRead the full Spinlock Deckvest 6D review\n\n \n\nMustang Atlas 190 inflatable lifejacket\nRaises the bar in bladder design\nSpecifications: Buoyancy: 180N, Colour: Black, Red/Black,Weight 1.2kg, Features: Pro Sensor auto inflation, crotch strap, pram style sprayhood, automatic strobe light, smart bladder design\nReasons to Buy: Very comfortable, innovative bladder design, high freeboard, understated casing design\nReasons to Avoid: Conservative outer styling might not appeal to those who like to make a statement.\nFrom the outside the casing looks pretty standard and dare I say it a bit bland. It doesn’t shout look at me, which I suspect will have as many nods of approval as there will be shrugs of where’s the pizzazz?\nIt has a smooth contoured shape to fit the body and once it’s on you can easily forget you’re wearing it. The back section is cut low and doesn’t impede on a collar or the back of your neck.\nThe weight is also distributed nicely across the whole body so there’s no hot spots. I tried this on over the top of a T-shirt and then later with a lightweight foul weather jacket and both options were comfortable.  The quick adjust side buckles are a familiar premium feature and the tail end excess is dealt with neatly with velcro loops.\nWhere the lifejacket really shines though is when it is deployed as an inflated bladder.\nThe sprayhood has a pram-style arch support which keeps it from collapsing on your head and keeps the plastic away from your face. It also makes it very easy to deploy and pull forward.  Two loops pull down and go over each bladder end.\nThey’ve thought about emergency beacon positioning too, though these were still being certified for use at the time of testing. There’s a dedicated area for a personal locator beacon or personal AIS beacon to attach to on the right-hand lower bladder section which is unencumbered by the sprayhood.\nIn the water I was able to scull backwards and maneuver really easily as there was plenty of room for arm articulation.\nBuy it now\nBuy it now from YouBoat\nNote: We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site, at no extra cost to you.

It also comes in a range of specification levels to suit individual needs.\nReasons to Avoid: This test model version comes without a sprayhood or light which would be essential for any offshore or coastal use after dark. Make sure you opt for the higher spec model.\nVerdict: This is without doubt a highly capable lifejacket. It fits well both shoreside and in the water. The extra buoyancy is noticeable in the longer bladder. We were unable to test the fully fledged offshore equipped lifejacket and if this lifejacket suits you, then make sure you opt for that extra specification.\nRead the full Baltic Force review\nBuy Baltic Force from tradeinn.com\n\nToni wearing Seago 3Dynamic 190N lifejacket\n\nSeago 3Dynamic Automatic inflatable lifejacket PFD\nSpecifications: Chest size: 55 to 140cm, Buoyancy: 300N, Colour: Carbon/black, Features: Double crutch strap, pro sensor firing head, neoprene collar, harness included\nReasons to Buy: This lifejacket looks smart and generally well sculpted to form fit. The bladder has a crossover design to stop waves funneling into your face.\nReasons to Avoid: It is really difficult to re-pack after inflation/re-arming. It also has a poorly designed sprayhood, the light us poorly positioned and might be a bit snug on larger people.\nVerdict: The Seago 3Dynamic looks to offer so much on paper but in practice we found it had one too many compromises for our tastes. It is comfortable, but repacking is a real faff. the buckle was fiddly and the sprayhood was subpar. A little more thought into the layout and practicalities of this lifejacket could turn it around though to be a solid contender.\nRead the full Seago 3Dynamic review\nBuy Seago 3Dynamic from eBay\n\nworn by Anna\n\nTeamO Backtow inflatable lifejacket PFD with unique harness system\nHighest scoring on test\nReasons to Buy: This lifejacket has a smart sculpted design, excellent sprayhood and innovative design with backtow harness.\nReasons to Avoid: If you deploy the backtow, you’re going to need to know how to put that back together or take it to a service centre.\nVerdict: A truly excellent lifejacket with innovation at its heart and the user practicality forefront.  The complexity of the backtow element means that rearming it in a hurry, unless you’re a dab hand already and have practiced shoreside, might leave you reaching for the spare lifejacket and sending this one off for someone else to do it for you.\nRead the full TeamO Backtow review\nBuy TeamO Backtow from promarinestore.co.uk\nBuy it now from YouBoat\n\nOcean Safety Sport Pro 170 ADV inflatable lifejacket PFD\nSpecifications: Colour: Carbon / Sky, Features: Pro sensor with indicator window, spray hood, storage pocket\nReasons to Buy: smart stylish design from a reputable brand, neat built in stowage pocket suitable for a PLB\nReasons to Avoid: small sprayhood feels claustrophobic and too tight around the head, the trigger toggle should have better stowage to avoid accidental trigger or to avoid unsafe tucking away by users.\nVerdict: This is a comfortable, sturdy, good quality and relatively well specified lifejacket at a good price. It has some great features and comes as standard with the basic equipment for going out of sight of land at night. The crossover bladder is a good design to stop waves funneling into the face, but we would advise to upgrade the sprayhood and light position to have a better in-water performance should you ever need it.\nRead the full Ocean Safety Sport Pro review\nBuy Ocean Safety Sport Pro 170N ADV from marinestore.com\n\nSpinlock Vito 170N Hammar automatic inflatable lifejacket\nSpecifications: Buoyancy: 170N, Features: Pylon Lifejacket Light, Lume-On, Toggle attachment point for optional Chest Pack (DW-PCC)\nReasons to Buy: One of the best sprayhoods we’ve tested, low profile lifejacket casing, Hammar trigger means you can use this in wild sailing conditions without accidental triggering.\nReasons to Avoid: Hammar trigger means re-arming this is a faff. Quite rigid construction, might not fit smaller people as adjustment will go only as small as a size 8 European female.\nVerdict: This is used by a variety of professional teams, including Volvo ocean racers. The Hammar trigger mechanism is a matter for you to decide if it’s right for you. They do sell the Vito with the pro sensor trigger too. The over the head donning is a love it or loathe it style and whilst it can feel very secure and the harness loop is excellent, passing this over your head, large collar and other foulies in a rush can feel a bit claustrophobic. The back is low cut though and the sprayhood is stowed in a back panel keeping the bulk away from the collar area. It is an excellent lifejacket and has scored highly in our early test scores. The full test review is coming soon,\nBuy Spinlock Vito 170N Hammar from thewetworks.co.uk\nOcean Lifejackets 270N +\nThe best lifejackets for boaters and sailors\n\nSpinlock Deckvest 6d 275N automatic inflatable lifejacket (single chamber)\nSpecifications: Buoyancy: 170N, Features: Pro sensor automatic inflation, Spinlock harness release system, structured spray hood\nReasons to Buy: It has a larger capacity bladder for superior righting and buoyancy. It can have HRS facility and is compatibility with other spinlock products.\nReasons to Avoid: It feels noticeably larger/bulkier than a 190N. It might impede access to liferaft if you are a smaller person.\nVerdict: Our pool tester Phil noted how much confidence this lifejacket inspired in the water. The bladder is significantly larger and provides a much greater buoyancy and visibility. It is large though, so we don’t recommend this for day to day sailing. The weight of the lifejacket comes in at 1529grams, which is 200g more than the standard 170N deckvest. This might not seem a great deal but over the course of a day, wearing this might be quite fatiguing. Of course, if you are wearing a large immersion suit or other bulky clothes or dry suit for use in deep ocean conditions, you will be very glad of the extra this lifejacket offers.\n Buy Spinlock Deckvest 6D 275N from piratescave.co.uk\n\nTeamO Backtow 275N inflatable lifejacket\nSpecifications: Buoyancy: 275N, Features: Pro sensor automatic inflation, backtow harness system\nReasons to Buy: It has a larger capacity bladder for superior righting and buoyancy. Extra buoyancy for serious offshore sailing.\nReasons to Avoid: It feels noticeably larger/bulkier than a 190N. It might impede access to liferaft if you are a smaller person.\nVerdict: This is a larger capacity lifejacket and really, it’s just a larger version of the highly rated and well respected original Backtow lifejacket.\nBuy it Now\n \nCoastal Lifejackets 150-180N\nThe best inflatable lifejackets for boaters and sailors who sail coastal waters and ride in ribs, tenders and dinghies\n\nBaltic Epiq 165N Auto Inflatable Lifejacket Aqua Blue 40-150kg\nSpecifications: Size: Adult (one size) Buoyancy, 165N,  5-Year warranty, Made from partially recycled materials, Manufactured in Europe\nReasons to Buy: Lightweight and flexible, it forms to your body shape easily. A simple over the head design keeps fastenings away from the front so fewer things to snag.\nReasons to Avoid: Some people don’t like the over the head style of donning a lifejacket.\nWhat I think of it: I use this lifejacket almost every day as I jump in and out of my tender to get to and from my boat on its mooring. it’s light weight, easily fits over my gear and I barely notice I’m wearing it. Given the softness of the lifejacket it also stows really neatly in my car and tucks neatly away on board too.\nAIS beacon and a light as I often dinghy alone at night in a busy shipping area and I’d like to be seen/helped if I fell in and was drifting on a fast ebb tide near the shipping. The Softer casing allows ample room for any extras you want to add.\nBuy it now\n\nfitting and adjusting with Anna\n\nBaltic Athena Auto Inflatable Lifejacket\nbest women’s specific lifejacket\nSpecifications: Size: Adult (one size), Colour: White or black, Inflate: Auto inflatable, 165n\nReasons to Buy: This lifejacket is cut for women and fits really well over foul weather clothes and light weight layers. It is comfortable and easy to move around in. It is easy to fasten in all conditions. It is easy to repack and easy to check the firing mechanism.\nReasons to Avoid: The bladder might be a bit tight around the neck when inflated wearing a large foul weather jacket collar and this can be uncomfortable.\nVerdict: This is an excellent choice of lifejacket for women who do a host of boating activities. High praise from all who tried this lifejacket in the dry.\nRead the full Baltic Athena review\nBuy Baltic Athena Auto Inflatable Lifejacket from tradeinn.com\nNote: We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site, at no extra cost to you.

There are very few details to get caught or snag. The best feature are that it’s really easy to repack, fits smaller adult body types and has a high visibility bladder.\nReasons to Avoid: This might feel a little restrictive on some people with the over-the-head method of donning. It might not suit larger bodies.\nVerdict: This no frills but stylish lifejacket performs well both off and on the water. It is great for everyday wear and is unobtrusive and easy to forget you’re wearing it.\nRead the full Spinlock Deckvest review\n\n \n\nSeago Seaguard 165N Inflatable Lifejacket\nbest budget lifejacket\nSpecifications: Size: Adult (one size), Buoyancy: 165N, Material: Nylon, Colour: Navy/grey, \nReasons to Buy: Excellent value for money. The cross over bladder design works well. There’s room in the casing to add a sprayhood and light. It also comes in a version with a harness loop.\nReasons to Avoid: There are a few little snaggy areas where the straps or toggles could be tucked away better.\nVerdict: We were very pleased with the performance of this lifejacket. Some would argue that it doesn’t look super stylish, but it doesn’t offend either. Where it excels is as a lifejacket in the water, and that’s where it really counts.\nRead the full Seago Seaguard review\nBuy Seago Seaguard from Pirates Cave\n\nchecking adjustment\n\nCrewsaver Crewfit+ 180N pro inflatable lifejacket PFD\n“best premium coastal lifejacket”\nSpecifications:  Size: Adult (one size), Buoyancy: 180N,  Colour: Black,  Features: Soft loop D-ring for attaching harness\nReasons to Buy: It’s a smart black lifejacket that will blend in with any outfit. If you’re all about minimal, understated style this is the lifejacket for you. Along with being fitted with sprayhood and light as standard, it also has a well designed wide bladder. It is very comfortable when worn day to day. Plus, it’s easy to adjust.\nReasons to Avoid: At the end of the day unpacking and repacking will take a longer as the rearming the firing mechanism is really fiddly. If you fly regularly with this lifejacket, the CO2 bottle seal will be an annoyance.\nVerdict: This is an excellent lifejacket, leading the way with coastal lifejackets that will take you offshore and into the night with its well positioned strobe light and nicely designed sprayhood. The thoughtful design is apparent throughout, but perhaps was taken one step too far with the CO2 bottle anti-unscrew seal feature making it a poor choice for frequent flyers but an excellent choice for people who worry about their CO2 bottles coming unscrewed.\nRead the full Crewsaver Crewfit+ review\nBuy Crewsaver Crewfit+ 180N Pro from Marinestore\n \n\nTeamO Micro lifejacket adjustment\n\nTeamO Micro lightweight inflatable lifejacket for sport boats\nSpecifications: Size: Adult (one size), Buoyancy: 170N, Colour: Black/Orange, Black/Yellow and Blue/Yellow, Features: Ultra light weight (approximately 900g), adjustable waist belt and 170 Newtons of Buoyancy\nReasons to Buy: Super skinny lightweight lifejacket, one of the lightest on test at 860grams.\nReasons to Avoid: A bit of a pig to repack. Very basic with no room for add-ons such as a light or sprayhood\nVerdict: The target market for the stylish TeamO Micro is likely to be for those who use RIBs, go day boating and motorboating and for other inshore sheltered water activities. If you want a lifejacket with the smallest footprint, then this may well fit the bill. If you are looking for a lifejacket that you can add to later with additional safety gear, then you might look elsewhere.\nRead the full TeamO Micro review\nBuy TeamO Micro Ultra Light from sheridanmarine.com\n\nlifejacket worn by Alex\n\nOcean Safety Sport 170 ADV inflatable lifejacket\nSpecifications: Colour: Navy, red and carbon,  Buoyancy: 170N, Features: Single crotch strap, side adjustment for bespoke fit and soft loop harness point for safety harness (harness version only)\nReasons to Buy: One of the reasons to buy this option is that it’s a smart looking lifejacket. It’s also a ocean safety brand is well established and trusted with service centres readily available everywhere. Plus, it has a crossover bladder design.\nReasons to Avoid: As per a previous test conducted on this lifejacket, it has suboptimal positioning of the CO2 canister on the curve of the bladder which causes it to rotate on inflation and jab into the chest or ribs of the wearer.\nVerdict: Whilst there’s no doubt this is a good quality ISO rated lifejacket, it is smart and fits well, adjusts well and functions well in all aspects, however there’s no escaping its shortcomings in respect to the bottle position and the underwhelmingly small sprayhood.\nRead the full Ocean Safety Sport review\nBuy Ocean Safety Sport ADV from Ocean Safety (UK)\n\nJames wearing the lifejacket\n\nHelly Hansen Sail Safe inflatable lifejacket PFD\nSpecifications: Size: STD, Colour: Navy and alert red, Fiber content: 100% Polyamide, Features: UML Water activated automatic inflation sensor\nReasons to Buy: This option is lightweight and easy to stow. It has a no frills design, neat stowage for the crotch strap on the back of the life jacket straps.\nReasons to Avoid: The performance was adequate in all areas but didn’t excel in any particular area.\nVerdict: The Helly Hansen Sail Safe lifejacket is a lightweight coastal lifejacket with the ubiquitous HH branding. You get good performance all over but for the (relatively high) price it does feel that you are paying for a name and higher specified lifejackets are available at a lower price.\nRead the full Helly Hansen Sailsafe review\nBuy Helly Hansen SailSafe from hellyhansen.com\n\nToby wearing lifejacket\n\nWaveline inflatable 165N lifejacket\nSpecifications:  Size: Suitable for weights above 40kg, Buoyancy: 165N, Material: 600D polyester outer shell and coarse polyester webbing, Features:Velcro closure cover and lifting loop\nReasons to Buy: This is the lightest on test and weighs just 800g fully armed. The flat profile is comfortable to wear. The velcro closure makes this life jacket really easy to check the arming mechanism and really easy to re-pack. It’s also very good value for money.\nReasons to Avoid: If style is something you want to consider, this is probably not the option for you. There’s also nowhere to stow excess webbing after adjustment.\nVerdict: The Waveline 165N auto lifejacket is an excellent budget option that works well in the water when inflated and is a no frills option for getting out on the water boating safely. A lightweight and simple lifejacket that is tried and tested the world over.\nRead the full Waveline review\nBuy Waveline 165N from eBay\n \nOur previously tested lifejackets from 2017 Group test\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\nBaltic 150 Race SL lifejacket\nRead the full review for the Baltic Race SL lifejacket\nSpecifications:  Size: ‎50-110 Kg, Features: Anti tangle back, padded shoulders, integrated safety harness, etro-reflective patches, whistle and detachable crutch strap\nReasons to Buy: It has good padding and a metal harness tether loop.\nReasons to Avoid: The lifejacket’s smaller buoyancy meant a slower roll over time.\nVerdict: The padding was comfortable, although the inflation tube and light assembly inside the lifejacket sat over the collar bone, which could create a pressure point over time. Unlike the longer bladder of the other Baltic lifejackets, this had a shorter, higher bladder with more rounded lobes. The standard Baltic hood had a good support arch, but the elastic straps tended to slip off the bladder. It also let spray in.\nBuy it now on Amazon\n\nCrewsaver Ergofit+ 190N lifejacket\nRead the full review of Crewsaver Ergofit 190\nSpecifications: Buoyancy: ‎190N, Features: Three-layer cover, inflatable chin support, stainless steel buckle, AIS and MOB Lifesavers compatible\nReasons to Buy: Impressive buoyancy and has an excellent sprayhood.\nReasons to Avoid: It’s a little rigid and bulky.\nVerdict: If performance in the water is the most important aspect of a lifejacket, the Ergofit+ 190N was streets ahead of the other lifejackets tested. It was one of the fastest to inflate, but more importantly it was a good second or two ahead on the rotation test. It was very difficult for the tester to get onto their front to begin the test at all, and they spun over in close to one second. The Crewsaver Ergofit+ 190N also produced the best freeboard figures with up to 4cm more than some of the other lifejackets.\nBuy it now on eBay (marinesuperstore)\nBuy it now from Gael Force Marine\n\nHelly Hansen Sailsafe Race 170 Auto lifejacket\nRead the full review of the Helly Hansen Sailsafe Race\nSpecifications: Buoyancy: ‎170N, Features: Hammar Hydrostatic pressure automatic inflation sensor, SOLAS approved Reflective elements, 5000N reinforced grab loop\nReasons to Buy: The hammar has an auto activation function and is fast to inflate.\nReasons to Avoid: The thigh straps might not be for everyone and its buckles slip too easily.\nVerdict: Hammar inflation and an inspection window make checking and maintaining the lifejacket simple. It sits flat against the body but includes space to add in an MOB beacon or PLB. The thigh straps are slightly more complex to fit, they need to be snug so they don’t slip down and limit movement. The lifejacket was the fastest to inflate on test (2017) The hood is well-made with a supporting arch and good ventilation at the sides and front, and well-located reflective strips.\nBuy it now on Hellyhansen.com\n\nThe back length is adjustable, one of only two lifejackets to offer this\nPlastimo SL 180 lifejacket\nRead the full review of the Plastimo SL 170\nSpecifications: Buoyancy: ‎180N, Features: Double thigh support, retro-reflective tape, quick-closing zip\nReasons to Buy: The adjustable back, good maneuverability in the water and storage for MOB built-in make this a good lifejacket for your yacht.\nReasons to Avoid: It has a slightly disconcerting soft feel when inflated compared to other conventionally constructed lifejackets.\nVerdict: With adjustable back length, (one of only a couple of lifejackets to offer this) and inspection windowvia dedicated zip opening and a separate stowage place for a personal beacon, this is a versatile lifejacket.\nThis jacket is designed to remain soft and flexible once inflated. We found this disconcerting initially as it felt like it had not fully inflated. The sewn-in sprayhood was easy to find with a string to pull forwards. The oral inflation tube was less simple to use.\nBuy it now on tradeinn.com\n \nLifejackets group test – what we scored our lifejackets on\n\nAdjust speed ease difficulty\n\nOur testers checked how easy and quickly our lifejackets were able to change from full foulies, then down to a t-shirt then back again. The double adjuster was a popular method and was scored highly by our testers.\nFastening buckle ease with gloves\n\nThe ease with which we can fasten and unfasten the various buckles, including with gloves or cold hands. Seabelt style buckles were generally scored very highly.\nComfort men women body size\n\nFront cross-over design\n\nThe cut and design of lifejackets varies a lot. From high cut waistcoat styles that suited the men or wider shouldered and taller people and the longer in the body cut lifejackets tended to suit a slimmer person with a waist for the lifejacket to cinch into.\nPracticality . bulk snagging\n\nWaistband stowage\n\nSome lifejackets have been well thought through. What do we do with the long surplus piece of webbing? what about all the flappy strappy bits? Are they neatly stowed? Lifejackets that had better stowage of surplus dangly bits were scored highly.\nManual inflated view and fitment\n\nWe tried all of the lifejackets shoreside, manually inflated and looked for the essential gear, whether it fell readily to hand and how the lifejacket fitted around the body in its fully inflated lifejaclet mode. A couple of the lifejackets had top up tubes that were a bit of a stretch to reach and some were difficult to locate the whistle or lifting strop.\nEase of checking and repacking\n\nRepacking the lifejacket\n\nSome of our lifejackets just slipped back into their casing without a fuss, others didn’t want to go back in without a bit of a wrestle. The velcro closure lifejackets are the easiest and the tightly packed ones with all the bells and whistles required a little more consideration to careful tucking and folding. Most had easy access to check the arming mechanism within a few brief seconds.\nSprayhood\n\nPhil during the pool test with sprayhood deployed\n\nWhere a lifejacket was fitted with a sprayhood we scored it. Some sprayhood were considerably better designed than others. Of the coastal lifejackets on test the Crewsaver was outstanding.\nPersonal Beacon stowage\n\nThe offshore lifejackets should reasonably be expected to have adequate stowage provision for a personal locator beacon or AIS.  Some were much better equipped than others. The Ocean Safety Sport Pro ADV has a pocket built in, the Spinlock Deckvest 6D has an optional side pouch which is excellent.\nIn water testing\n\nPlunge test\n\nWe tested every lifejacket in the pool and ran each one through basic personal sea survival drills, from manual inflation, auto inflation, swimming, rafting and climbing into a liferaft, we looked at the performance of all our best lifejackets for boaters in general use.\nIt is clear to see that all lifejackets are not made equal. Certainly not in how they feel from person to person.\nWhilst all of our lifejackets on test performed well according to basic safety standards, they all have elements that could be tweeked and adjusted to be better functioning or designed and all of them have their unique selling points.\nA final note from the Tech Editor : Fox Morgan\n\nMy personal favourite lifejacket is the old Kru Sport, as it fits me so well. They no longer make this waistcoat style model, but the sprayhood and equipment storage capacity on this one is excellent. My AIS beacon fits on a webbing belt on the bladder. I familiarise myself with my lifejacket manually inflated once or twice a year or before every big offshore race. I inspect it on a regular basis and check the arming mechanism before every outing. \n\nOnce you have chosen the best lifejacket that suits your needs, make sure you get to know it well. Not just in it’s rolled away form, but as a lifejacket, inflated. Know where your essential safety kit is stowed. Where is the whistle and lifting strop? Put your lifejacket on and feel around for them. Store this in your memory. The least sensible time to be doing this for the first time is when you actually need them.\n\nOur lifejacket testing team were:\n\nAlex :  Professional Skipper of traditional sailing vessels (Charlestown Harbour)\n\nPaula : Chief at Charlestown Harbour\n\nToni : Ex RNLI lifeaboatman, Ex Brixham fisherman, Professional skipper and owner of traditional sailing and fishing vessels\n\nPhil : Ex Lifeboatman, Ex Brixham fisherman, Ex Navy Chief Engineer, Principle sea survival skills training officer, Professional Skipper and University HE lecturer.\n\nAnna :  Clipper Sailing Crew and experienced offshore sailor/racer\n\nJames : Retired GP and experienced offshore sailor/racer\n\nMike : Outward bound sailing instructor, poolside safety and drills at Western Maritime Training\n\nToby : Experienced sailor and dinghy racer, Senior writer at Future Marine Group\n\nFox : Professional sailing skipper, experienced offshore sailor/racer, Senior HE University lecturer, Tech Ed at Future Marine Group\nOur lifejacket testing was held over several days.\n\nOur dry testing day was hosted by Charlestown Harbour.\nWe tested all of our lifejackets for the ease of adjustment from wearing it over bulky clothes to t-shirts and then back to bulky clothes.\nWe looked at how easy or difficult our lifejackets were to fasten and unfasten and then try that again with cold hands or with gloves on.\nWe looked at the fitment of crotch straps and for any loose or dangling straps or toggles that might get snagged by accident when worn in a marine environment.\n\nWe manually inflated all of our lifejackets and assessed their onboard equipment and location. Some lifejackets have the minimum or lifting strop, whistle and top up tube, others have spray hoods fitted and lights. We assessed how easy those items were to find and use when wearing the lifejacket inflated.\nWhere suitable, we looked at where a personal locator beacon or personal ais beacon would fit on or within the lifejacket casing or bladder.\nWe packed away our lifejackets and assessed how easy or difficult they were to stow back into their casings. While we were doing this, we also looked at how easy it would be to rearm a lifejacket if it had been triggered.\n\nOur Pool testing day was held in Plymouth Life Centre Diving Pool and organised by Western Maritime Training.\nIn the pool we had a liferaft set in place for us to run through standard sea survival drills and practice. Western Maritime Training kindly set the pool up for us as per standard STCW personal survival techniques training days.\nWe highly recommend that anyone who spends time heading out of sight of land for leisure or pleasure should consider doing this course.\nWhile we were in the pool area, we assessed the manual trigger mechanism and auto inflate mechanism of lifejackets. How hard is it to pull the trigger to activate the gas canister or when auto inflating, did the lifejacket turn us over quickly?\nWe assessed the comfort of the lifejacket when inflated and how easy or difficult they are to readjust whilst in the water. such as tightening crotch straps or cinching in waistbands.\nWhere lifejackets were fitted with a sprayhood, we looked at how easy it was to locate and pull over the bladder, checking its effectiveness/practicality.\n\nWe formed a human safety circle and assessed what practical grab holds our lifejackets had, then we climbed into a liferaft, also checking for practical use and ability to physically handle a person giving them assistance to enter the liferaft.\nAfter testing\nWe hung up our inflated lifejackets to dry and confirmed that all remained fully inflated for well over 48hours. In fact all of our test lifejackets remained inflated for two weeks, by which time only one of them had slightly started to soften.\nWhat’s the scores?\nEach lifejacket was independently scored by members of the testing team.\nWe took those scores and averaged them for each criteria.\nWe added up the individual element scores and converted this to a percentage rating.\nThroughout the process all notes were taken from our testers and those comments can be seen in each review and within our buyers guide.\n \n \nNote: all of our lifejackets tested conform to either  ISO 12402-3 (coastal/non harness) or iSO 12401 (harness versions), and this means that they all meet the basic safety standards you would expect from a lifejacket.\nIn order to conduct unbiased testing, our test team were given full freedom to test and evaluate the lifejackets presented to them on the tests days. Their opinions are made in a professional capacity and skippers and end users of the products and are a result of direct hands on experience. This does not override any official safety rating or certification.\nlegal disclaimer is available here\nThe post We Tested The Best Inflatable Lifejacket and PFD’s for Boating and Sailing appeared first on Yachting Monthly.",

I was baffled: we were still 40 kilometres from the coast. Such hinterland support for sailing was new to me: back home a candy-floss stick’s length from the coast, folks knew nothing and cared less about the maritime world.</p>\n<p>On more than one occasion I’ve been asked by day-trippers, whether the dark lump of Kent on the other side of the Thames Estuary is France.

Photo: Christophe Favreau/PPL/GGR\nMany years ago, I was on a family motoring holiday driving towards Brittany when, in a small town, we passed under a banner proclaiming a regatta. I was baffled: we were still 40 kilometres from the coast. Such hinterland support for sailing was new to me: back home a candy-floss stick’s length from the coast, folks knew nothing and cared less about the maritime world.\nOn more than one occasion I’ve been asked by day-trippers, whether the dark lump of Kent on the other side of the Thames Estuary is France. I once even overheard a young mum say: ‘Look, you can see Calais,’ as she pointed to Sheerness nine miles away.\nI recently mentioned this to six-times solo circumnavigator Jean-Luc Van Den Heede who was publicising his autobiography (The Last Sea Dog, Fernhurst Books, 2024). The 74-year-old winner of the 2019 Golden Globe Race told me he believes his countrymen’s love of the sea comes from the accounts of great sailors such as Alain Gerbault, Bernard Moitessier, Eric Tabarly and Isabelle Autissier to name but four.\n‘They provide a dream,’ he said, ‘for most people the thought of a human being sailing alone across an ocean is compelling.

And yet sailing does not appear to be in the DNA of the British. If anyone understands – and wants to manipulate – the zeitgeist of the common man it’s a politician.\nTherefore, you won’t find sailors being lionised with a visit to No. 10 Downing Street, unlike in France where, in 1990, the wily, old President Francois Mitterrand welcomed the 13 competitors of the first Vendée Globe Race, at the Elysée Palace.\n‘What really impressed me was his knowledge of each sailor,’ Jean-Luc, who came third in the race, said. ‘He knew them by name, where they lived.’ Jean-Luc now acts as an adviser to those who have conquered that fear and wish to race offshore.\nThe man who has rounded Cape Horn 12 times, said: ‘The original Golden Globe Race created a spirit of adventure and one not associated with money.

Examine the blades for ‘dezincification’, which appears as a mottled red/brown appearance on the surface, indicating that the zinc in the bronze alloy has been corroded away.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100484\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100484\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100484\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_howitworks.3_shutterstock_2285843187-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_howitworks.3_shutterstock_2285843187-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_howitworks.3_shutterstock_2285843187-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_howitworks.3_shutterstock_2285843187-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_howitworks.3_shutterstock_2285843187-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_howitworks.3_shutterstock_2285843187.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100484\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Check the anode regularly to prevent dezincification, which will appear as mottled red / brown surface on the prop</p></div>\n<p>Severe corrosion will show a pitted surface and can weaken the blade significantly. If dezincification is present, check the anodes. Saildrive legs have relatively small anodes, so dezincification is more likely on heavier, folding props. This could require frequent anode replacement.</p>\n<h2>Fixed-blade prop removal</h2>\n<p>Remove the split pin or lock washer and undo the nut a few turns – this prevents the prop shooting off if it’s difficult to remove and you have to resort to force.

Apply heat all around the prop hub. Gently knock the prop backwards, using a hammer and a block of wood to cushion the blows. Remove the prop nut and slide the prop off the shaft.</p>\n<h2>Folding prop removal</h2>\n<p>Grease the folding gear teeth with waterproof grease and check for full and free operation.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Simple Boat Maintenance author Pat Manley explains the best way to clean and remove a boat's propeller\nCheck prop kick astern when \nalongside, then try out how the \nboat responds in open water\nPropeller fouling causes a marked drop in performance, while electrolytic corrosion can cause serious propeller damage. Propellers should, therefore, be cleaned annually – but a quick clean of the prop any time that your boat is out of the water will always be worthwhile.\nCleaning propellers\nThoroughly clean the prop using this order: paint scraper, wire brush on an electric drill, waterproof abrasive paper. Examine the blades for ‘dezincification’, which appears as a mottled red/brown appearance on the surface, indicating that the zinc in the bronze alloy has been corroded away.\n\nCheck the anode regularly to prevent dezincification, which will appear as mottled red / brown surface on the prop\n\nSevere corrosion will show a pitted surface and can weaken the blade significantly. If dezincification is present, check the anodes. Saildrive legs have relatively small anodes, so dezincification is more likely on heavier, folding props. This could require frequent anode replacement.\nFixed-blade prop removal\nRemove the split pin or lock washer and undo the nut a few turns – this prevents the prop shooting off if it’s difficult to remove and you have to resort to force. If the prop cannot be moved backwards along its taper, you will have to use a prop puller.\n\nTake care after using a blowtorch – the prop will be hot!\n\nIt’s probable that the amateur will not have this tool, so the alternative is to heat the prop with a gas blowtorch so that the hub expands. Apply heat all around the prop hub. Gently knock the prop backwards, using a hammer and a block of wood to cushion the blows. Remove the prop nut and slide the prop off the shaft.\nFolding prop removal\nGrease the folding gear teeth with waterproof grease and check for full and free operation. If stiffness is found, remove the blades and clean all surfaces. There are usually locking bolts preventing the pivot pins from falling out. Remove these. Drive out each pivot pin.\n\nUse a prop puller if you can get hold of one\n\nPull the blade out of its socket. Remove the other blades. Clean all surfaces thoroughly. Replace the first blade, greasing with waterproof grease. Align the next blade’s gear so that the extension is the same for each blade.\nInsert the pivot pin and apply grease. Assemble the third blade for a three-blade prop. Check for full, free and synchronised movement of the blades. Refit any locking devices. Fit new hub anode, if applicable.\nEnjoyed reading this?\nA subscription to Yachting Monthly magazine costs around 40% less than the cover price, so you can save money compared to buying single issues.\nPrint and digital editions are available through Magazines Direct – where you can also find the latest deals.\nYM is packed with information to help you get the most from your time on the water.\nTake your seamanship to the next level with tips, advice and skills from our experts\nImpartial in-depth reviews of the latest yachts and equipment\nCruising guides to help you reach those dream destinations\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nThe post How to clean and remove a boat’s propeller appeared first on Yachting Monthly.",

With a more <a href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/boat-events/new-cornish-regatta-a-classic-boatbuilding-legacy-97757\">traditional hull</a> shape, narrower waterline and seaworthy layout, she also sailed extremely well upwind in a blow.</p>\n<p>As a Swedish boat, she also had the level of finish and craftsmanship that you would expect from a Scandinavian boat. Her little sister, the Linjett 36, is designed to be an evolution of those ideals, sitting between the 34 and the 39.</p>\n<p>There are nods to modern ideas, such as the fixed bowsprit (a first for Linjett), twin wheels (though single rudder) and large hull windows, but she has staunchly resisted ultra-wide hull shapes, hull chines or wide open cockpits.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100489\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100489\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100489\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.newboats_1perpg.02_Linjett_36_Back_Top_Side_Large-630x354.png\" alt=\"Large hull windows bring lots of light below\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.newboats_1perpg.02_Linjett_36_Back_Top_Side_Large-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.newboats_1perpg.02_Linjett_36_Back_Top_Side_Large-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.newboats_1perpg.02_Linjett_36_Back_Top_Side_Large-768x432.png 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.newboats_1perpg.02_Linjett_36_Back_Top_Side_Large-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.newboats_1perpg.02_Linjett_36_Back_Top_Side_Large.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100489\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Large hull windows bring lots of light below</p></div>\n<p>Instead the semi-enclosed cockpit with deep coamings and small sugar scoop stern, the narrower, rounded hull shapes, fine entry and slightly raked bow look a little old-fashioned. You’d be wrong in thinking that she isn’t a modern boat with real performance potential, however, as witnessed by a moderately deep bulb keel, high aspect ratio rudder, under deck headsail furler and the ability to set a code zero or asymmetric.</p>\n<p>It’s just that she’s aimed at sailors who want to be able to make progress to windward under sail even when it’s rough, and who care about how the boat handles at sea.</p>\n<p>To that end, she is probably more of a northern Europe and Baltic kind of boat, rather than a Med boat, as there are no vast sunpads anywhere.</p>\n<p>Sensible features, such as the coachroof-mounted mainsheet traveller and self- tacking jib, will make the boat safe and easy to handle. Down below, priority has been given to functionality for moving in and out of bunks and around the galley and heads rather than big open spaces or maximising berths.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100490\"

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Theo Stocker looks at the new Thirty-six-foot Linjett 36, which has a more enclosed cockpit than on many new boats, a feature serious cruisers will welcome.\nThe Linjett 36\nWhen we sailed the Linjett 36’s big sister, the Linjett 39, last year, we thought she was a gorgeous cruising boat that would appeal to proper cruising sailors. With a more traditional hull shape, narrower waterline and seaworthy layout, she also sailed extremely well upwind in a blow.\nAs a Swedish boat, she also had the level of finish and craftsmanship that you would expect from a Scandinavian boat. Her little sister, the Linjett 36, is designed to be an evolution of those ideals, sitting between the 34 and the 39.\nThere are nods to modern ideas, such as the fixed bowsprit (a first for Linjett), twin wheels (though single rudder) and large hull windows, but she has staunchly resisted ultra-wide hull shapes, hull chines or wide open cockpits.\n\nLarge hull windows bring lots of light below\n\nInstead the semi-enclosed cockpit with deep coamings and small sugar scoop stern, the narrower, rounded hull shapes, fine entry and slightly raked bow look a little old-fashioned. You’d be wrong in thinking that she isn’t a modern boat with real performance potential, however, as witnessed by a moderately deep bulb keel, high aspect ratio rudder, under deck headsail furler and the ability to set a code zero or asymmetric.\nIt’s just that she’s aimed at sailors who want to be able to make progress to windward under sail even when it’s rough, and who care about how the boat handles at sea.\nTo that end, she is probably more of a northern Europe and Baltic kind of boat, rather than a Med boat, as there are no vast sunpads anywhere.\nSensible features, such as the coachroof-mounted mainsheet traveller and self- tacking jib, will make the boat safe and easy to handle. Down below, priority has been given to functionality for moving in and out of bunks and around the galley and heads rather than big open spaces or maximising berths.\n\nA self- tacking jib and coachroof mounted mainsheet keep sail handling easy and safe\n\nWhile all of this will come at a bit of a price, there’s probably less of a difference to more common production brands thanks to the high level of standard spec.\nThis is a boat I’m looking forward to sailing, hopefully when some arrive in the UK next year.\nArticle continues below…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nLinjett 39 first test: ‘There is a positive feel on the helm that builds in a predictable fashion’\nRosättra Boatyard believes it has the ideal option for those looking for a modern yacht with long-lasting appeal, the Linjett…\n£511,441.58\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nX-Yachts X43 review: fast passage making in comfort\nYou know the stars have aligned when you get Force 4-5 and bright sunshine, as well as a boat, crew,…\n£618,000.00\n\n\nLinjett 36 Specifications:\n– LOA 11m/ 36ft 1in\nwww.linjett.se\nEnjoyed reading this?\nA subscription to Yachting Monthly magazine costs around 40% less than the cover price, so you can save money compared to buying single issues.\nPrint and digital editions are available through Magazines Direct – where you can also find the latest deals.\nYM is packed with information to help you get the most from your time on the water.\nTake your seamanship to the next level with tips, advice and skills from our experts\nImpartial in-depth reviews of the latest yachts and equipment\nCruising guides to help you reach those dream destinations\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nThe post Linjett 36 first look: Nods to tradition for serious cruisers appeared first on Yachting Monthly.",

Once again, though for the first time since Brexit, we were heading for the Netherlands from Suffolk Yacht Harbour.</p>\n<p>Months in the planning, we were itching to cast off, but the reality was a nagging northeast Force 6. If we left, that would be a horrible first 6-8 hours.</p>\n<p>Like Hamlet, we dithered and delayed, and eventually set off the next afternoon, still northeast, but now Force 4 – it was manageable.</p>\n<p>Jenny, my crew, is an expert navigator and passage planner, very adept with modern technology – the perfect foil for my technological ineptitude. In her 20 years of sailing she has acquired RYA qualifications and done overseas delivery trips with Professional Yacht Deliveries. We share the helm, half hour on, half hour off. Like me, she enjoys the sailing rather than just being on a boat. Excellent crew and after 10 years she still comes back for more!</p>\n<p>Those of you with 10m-plus yachts and 20hp diesels will be wondering why I’m such a wimp. My Nova 27 is 50 years old with a single cylinder SABB 10hp.

Due to sunk shipping, small boats are advised to go north of Gabbard, which means heading northeast for 30 miles. For an old 27-footer, you need the help of the tide, in this case 2 knots, but you then have wind-over-tide – uncomfortable!</p>\n<p>In the event, there was enough east in the wind for us to romp up the Shipway to N Shipwash buoy at 7 knots speed over ground. In the dark, we motored round the top of Gabbard, the windfarm lit up like a floating city, all winking lights at different levels. Adding to the illuminations was a surprising amount of shipping, especially ferries.</p>\n<p>With just enough north in the wind, we were able to lay a course southeast across the North Hinder TSS and into the Borssele Pass. Unlike Thames Estuary wind farms, which are laid out in regular straight rows, Borssele is more random. Initially, the Pass was not obvious, but GPS established that we were in the right passage.</p>\n<p>By now, it was early afternoon with everything sparkling and we cheered the northeasterly as it sped us east at over 5 knots.

Roompot lock was straightforward; we motored over to the marina, tied up and flopped. Tired but satisfied with a successful crossing.</p>\n<h2>Bewildering brexit</h2>\n<p>Pre Brexit, sailors entered the Netherlands without bureaucracy. This time, it was very confusing.</p>\n<p>I struggled and swore my way through pre-trip online documents. It appears mandatory (really?) to have: boat registration, insurances, GHIC, passport, radio licence, ICC (incl CEVNI) and diesel receipts. And then more fun with online immigration forms for both countries with numerous links and references&#8230; help! The words ‘need’ and ‘must’ occur alarmingly frequently.</p>\n<p>So, on the first morning in Roompot Marina, we headed for the office with every document imaginable. The marina office staff spoke excellent English and phoned Immigration in Vlissingen.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100462\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100462\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100462\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.feat_HW_north_sea_crossing_8pg.04_ALAMY_2WF897W-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.feat_HW_north_sea_crossing_8pg.04_ALAMY_2WF897W-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.feat_HW_north_sea_crossing_8pg.04_ALAMY_2WF897W-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.feat_HW_north_sea_crossing_8pg.04_ALAMY_2WF897W-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.feat_HW_north_sea_crossing_8pg.04_ALAMY_2WF897W-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.feat_HW_north_sea_crossing_8pg.04_ALAMY_2WF897W.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100462\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">: The Zeeland Bridge opens to let tall masts through.

Though uniformed and bristling with weaponry, they were pleasant and helpful, their only interest being to stamp the passports. They were not remotely bothered with all the other stuff, and nor was anyone else throughout the trip. Hmmm?</p>\n<p>I was beginning to suspect that rubric and reality were not quite in sync.</p>\n<p>The Oosterschelde is a large inland sea created by the Dutch Delta Plan, crossed by a motorway on the Zeeland Bridge with spans 12m above high-tide level. I think the tip of Maisie’s aerial atop the mast is 12.5m. As the tide had been ebbing for two hours, we were modestly confident of getting through.</p>\n<p>As we approached our chosen span, a gauge at the base showed 13.5m. It is always a deceptive and alarming experience approaching a low bridge. It seems impossible that the mast and all will go under, but then&#8230; phew! I have no idea how close we were, but it looked very close.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100469\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100469\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100469\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.feat_HW_north_sea_crossing_8pg.17_John_skipper_ideal_conditions-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.feat_HW_north_sea_crossing_8pg.17_John_skipper_ideal_conditions-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.feat_HW_north_sea_crossing_8pg.17_John_skipper_ideal_conditions-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.feat_HW_north_sea_crossing_8pg.17_John_skipper_ideal_conditions-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.feat_HW_north_sea_crossing_8pg.17_John_skipper_ideal_conditions-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.feat_HW_north_sea_crossing_8pg.17_John_skipper_ideal_conditions.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100469\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Skipper John Kingsnorth enjoying the helm in ideal conditions.

So too with Sas van Goes, and, apart from wet and slimy walls, the procedure was straightforward. We exited into a beautiful stretch of tree-lined canal. To my shame, I was so taken with the vista that I nearly ran over a swimmer who, unperturbed, continued his dogged way towards the lock pontoon.</p>\n<p>A wake-up call to be vigilant. We negotiated many more swimmers, all in good humour and, seeing our ensign, hailed us like long-lost travellers. As we rounded a bend, thinking of phoning for a bridge opening ahead, a huge barge filled the canal, coming straight for us.</p>\n<p>No pictures with this one I’m afraid as it was: (a) get out of the way, (b) go aground, (c) rev engines to stay afloat but miss barge and (d) grab a fender. Yes, we were that close!

Officials also found it frustrating, as it has given them a lot more work.</li>\n<li><strong>Navigation:</strong> We were amazed that locks and canals were staffed, in good order and free. Our €1 tourist tax seemed very good value. There is a free publication available in every marina called ‘De Havengids’ (Zuid-Nederland). It is in Dutch but the pictures, maps and symbols are easy to figure out and provide very useful additional information for sailors.</li>\n<li><strong>Sea defences:</strong> In East Anglia we are concerned about coastal erosion. The Dutch have tackled it head on with miles and miles of dykes building in recreational facilities, so the top of the banks have cycle tracks, usually tarmac, and there are locks, canals and marinas everywhere.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Back in the Oosterschelde the northeast wind picked up and the ebb tide remained strong, making the Grevelingenmeer too much of a slog. Jenny had fond memories of Zierikzee so we happily changed plans and went there instead, having first visited it seven years before. It is another historic and picturesque town but not for this particular yarn.</p>\n<p>Later in the week back in Roompot, we enjoyed an evening beach walk, swim and restaurant ‘meal-for-two’ served on a plank!

There was no need to report in as I had filled in ‘the form’ before departure.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "To depart or not to depart? That is the question. Is it safer to stay, or suffer the wind and weather of a rough North Sea? \n\nWith apologies to Shakespeare – our dilemma could hardly be compared to Hamlet’s, but it was real. Once again, though for the first time since Brexit, we were heading for the Netherlands from Suffolk Yacht Harbour.\nMonths in the planning, we were itching to cast off, but the reality was a nagging northeast Force 6. If we left, that would be a horrible first 6-8 hours.\nLike Hamlet, we dithered and delayed, and eventually set off the next afternoon, still northeast, but now Force 4 – it was manageable.\nJenny, my crew, is an expert navigator and passage planner, very adept with modern technology – the perfect foil for my technological ineptitude. In her 20 years of sailing she has acquired RYA qualifications and done overseas delivery trips with Professional Yacht Deliveries. We share the helm, half hour on, half hour off. Like me, she enjoys the sailing rather than just being on a boat. Excellent crew and after 10 years she still comes back for more!\nThose of you with 10m-plus yachts and 20hp diesels will be wondering why I’m such a wimp. My Nova 27 is 50 years old with a single cylinder SABB 10hp. It is solid and reliable, but noisy and slow, so I sail as soon as is practical.\n\nMaisie sailing on the River Orwell. Photo: John Kingsnorth\n\nSailing to the southern Netherlands from Harwich, the first major obstacle is the Gabbard wind farm. Due to sunk shipping, small boats are advised to go north of Gabbard, which means heading northeast for 30 miles. For an old 27-footer, you need the help of the tide, in this case 2 knots, but you then have wind-over-tide – uncomfortable!\nIn the event, there was enough east in the wind for us to romp up the Shipway to N Shipwash buoy at 7 knots speed over ground. In the dark, we motored round the top of Gabbard, the windfarm lit up like a floating city, all winking lights at different levels. Adding to the illuminations was a surprising amount of shipping, especially ferries.\nWith just enough north in the wind, we were able to lay a course southeast across the North Hinder TSS and into the Borssele Pass. Unlike Thames Estuary wind farms, which are laid out in regular straight rows, Borssele is more random. Initially, the Pass was not obvious, but GPS established that we were in the right passage.\nBy now, it was early afternoon with everything sparkling and we cheered the northeasterly as it sped us east at over 5 knots. The ebbing tide helped across the Steenbank area and we had a glorious evening sail as we sedately creamed up the Roompot channel.\n\nA spinnaker run in the Oosterschelde. Photo: John Kingsnorth\n\nA calm sea, land visible on the starboard bow, and the sun a golden orb behind us. Roompot lock was straightforward; we motored over to the marina, tied up and flopped. Tired but satisfied with a successful crossing.\nBewildering brexit\nPre Brexit, sailors entered the Netherlands without bureaucracy. This time, it was very confusing.\nI struggled and swore my way through pre-trip online documents. It appears mandatory (really?) to have: boat registration, insurances, GHIC, passport, radio licence, ICC (incl CEVNI) and diesel receipts. And then more fun with online immigration forms for both countries with numerous links and references… help! The words ‘need’ and ‘must’ occur alarmingly frequently.\nSo, on the first morning in Roompot Marina, we headed for the office with every document imaginable. The marina office staff spoke excellent English and phoned Immigration in Vlissingen.\n\n: The Zeeland Bridge opens to let tall masts through. Photo: John Kingsnorth\n\nThey arrived in 20 minutes in a van kitted out as a mobile immigration office. Though uniformed and bristling with weaponry, they were pleasant and helpful, their only interest being to stamp the passports. They were not remotely bothered with all the other stuff, and nor was anyone else throughout the trip. Hmmm?\nI was beginning to suspect that rubric and reality were not quite in sync.\nThe Oosterschelde is a large inland sea created by the Dutch Delta Plan, crossed by a motorway on the Zeeland Bridge with spans 12m above high-tide level. I think the tip of Maisie’s aerial atop the mast is 12.5m. As the tide had been ebbing for two hours, we were modestly confident of getting through.\nAs we approached our chosen span, a gauge at the base showed 13.5m. It is always a deceptive and alarming experience approaching a low bridge. It seems impossible that the mast and all will go under, but then… phew! I have no idea how close we were, but it looked very close.\n\nSkipper John Kingsnorth enjoying the helm in ideal conditions. Photo: John Kingsnorth\n\nNavin’s excellent Cruising Guide to the Netherlands is never far from my armchair at home or in the cockpit aboard Maisie. On previous occasions we had done the Veerse Meer and this time wanted to explore the Grevelingenmeer, recommended by Navin.\nHe also rates Goes, off the Oosterschelde, which was easier to get to with sea conditions as they were. After a brief discussion with crew Jenny, we changed direction and charged off southwest at 5 knots, heading for Goes.\nA word about pronunciation – imagine clearing your throat and going ‘hoosh’ – you just about have ‘Goes’. I tried speaking Dutch once and the man looked at me blankly and asked me to speak English. Most Dutch speak good English and are happy to do so.\n\nThe Zeeland Bridge over the Oosterschelde. Photo: John Kingsnorth\n\nMany Dutch towns are accessed by locks and canals with clear traffic lights and a VHF channel. So too with Sas van Goes, and, apart from wet and slimy walls, the procedure was straightforward. We exited into a beautiful stretch of tree-lined canal. To my shame, I was so taken with the vista that I nearly ran over a swimmer who, unperturbed, continued his dogged way towards the lock pontoon.\nA wake-up call to be vigilant. We negotiated many more swimmers, all in good humour and, seeing our ensign, hailed us like long-lost travellers. As we rounded a bend, thinking of phoning for a bridge opening ahead, a huge barge filled the canal, coming straight for us.\nNo pictures with this one I’m afraid as it was: (a) get out of the way, (b) go aground, (c) rev engines to stay afloat but miss barge and (d) grab a fender. Yes, we were that close! Then, just as suddenly, all was quiet with the canal clear, the bridge open and on we pottered with heartbeats back to normal!\n\nMotoring along the Goes canal, avoiding some swimmers. Photo: John Kingsnorth\n\nExploring and stocking up\nIn Navin’s Cruising Guide to the Netherlands there is a picture of a little marina (reminiscent of the prettier parts of the Norfolk Broads) looking quieter and more attractive than the town centre berths.\nWhat a great spot! The helpful, friendly and chatty Havenmeister gave us our berth and proudly showed us our personal loo in the tower.\n\nView of Haarlem, a typical Dutch town, as seen on another trip. Photo: John Kingsnorth\n\nAfter photos and ablutions we had a brief walk into the centre of this typical and charming Dutch town. In the square, one restaurant was doing a particularly bustling trade and its ‘Menu of the Month’ was extremely good value for three delicious courses and lots of beer – a necessity in the heat. An after-dinner saunter brought us to the main church and some eye-catching murals, with one highlighting Ukrainian issues which I found particularly moving.\nThe next morning we replenished supplies at a nearby supermarket, with prices comparable to the UK. We returned to Maisie, as happy sailors and crammed cheeses, yoghurts, currant buns, apples, grapes, fruit juice and sparkling water into every onboard crevice we could find.\n\nThe WV De Werf Marina at Goes. Photo: John Kingsnorth\n\nBefore heading back for the Oosterschelde we compared notes on our Dutch experiences:\nBrexit: Universal sympathy from the Dutch who were bemused and puzzled by it. Officials also found it frustrating, as it has given them a lot more work.\nNavigation: We were amazed that locks and canals were staffed, in good order and free. Our €1 tourist tax seemed very good value. There is a free publication available in every marina called ‘De Havengids’ (Zuid-Nederland). It is in Dutch but the pictures, maps and symbols are easy to figure out and provide very useful additional information for sailors.\nSea defences: In East Anglia we are concerned about coastal erosion. The Dutch have tackled it head on with miles and miles of dykes building in recreational facilities, so the top of the banks have cycle tracks, usually tarmac, and there are locks, canals and marinas everywhere.\nBack in the Oosterschelde the northeast wind picked up and the ebb tide remained strong, making the Grevelingenmeer too much of a slog. Jenny had fond memories of Zierikzee so we happily changed plans and went there instead, having first visited it seven years before. It is another historic and picturesque town but not for this particular yarn.\nLater in the week back in Roompot, we enjoyed an evening beach walk, swim and restaurant ‘meal-for-two’ served on a plank! In the morning Dutch Immigration came and gave us our exit stamp and we departed.\n\nHistoric houses at Goes marina create an attractive backdrop. Photo: John Kingsnorth\n\nHeading home\nOur trip across the North Sea involved 54-mile starboard tack at 5 knots in bright sunshine. In his play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, Tom Stoppard has the two men, mid-sea, speculating on the whereabouts of England. ‘Just a conspiracy of cartographers, then?’ says Guildenstern. It feels that way until the cranes of Felixstowe loom out of the haze.\nOn entering the Orwell I rang Border Force and was told I could take the Q flag down. There was no need to report in as I had filled in ‘the form’ before departure. I just smiled and said thank you.\nI am already planning a return trip for next year, when I’m determined to get to the Grevelingenmeer or just back to any part of this wonderful sailing playground – which is only 25 hours away.\nI cannot recommend it highly enough. For the moment, I have the happy memories of this trip to reminisce over. Thank you, crew, for tolerating my foibles.

When we purchased her in 2010 she had a full-sized mainsail, conventional mainsheet and traveller, a simple rope kicker, two mainsail clew reefing lines, and ‘slugs in mast slot’ mainsail luff attachment.</p>\n<p>She was designed for fully crewed racing and we quickly found that the main issue with the mainsail systems was safety. The full-sized mainsail may have been good for light airs whilst racing with four crew on the rail, but it was just too big for cruising.</p>\n<p>The mainsheet and traveller were in the cockpit, creating a ‘death-zone’ during gybes. The rope kicker required a boom topping lift which proved to be a nuisance, and reefing without tack lines necessitated work at the mast. The mainsail luff attachment was difficult to reef due to the slugs jamming. In short, she was just too hazardous for two-handed cruising.</p>\n<p>She is very easily driven, so slowing her down is often our primary concern at sea. With the original mainsail, we very rarely set the full sail. This meant that one of the reefing lines was always in use and putting in the third reef required re-reeving the first reef line.</p>\n<p>So, when the time finally came for a new mainsail we had it made with the first-reef luff length and two deep reef points.</p>\n<p>Upwind the new sail works well in light breezes. A notable example would be the time when we sailed 600 miles to windward in 10-15 knots from Panama to Jamaica – and would have left most displacement 40ft cruisers in our wake!</p>\n<p>Broad-reaching with the new sail and our 130% yankee will give us boat speeds of five knots in 6-8 knots apparent – a 120-mile daily average and perfectly respectable for our little cruiser. It’s fair to say that our new smaller main has certainly been a huge improvement.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100434\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100434\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100434\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2b_Boom_brake_descender_on_second_tang_06-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2b_Boom_brake_descender_on_second_tang_06-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2b_Boom_brake_descender_on_second_tang_06-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2b_Boom_brake_descender_on_second_tang_06-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2b_Boom_brake_descender_on_second_tang_06-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2b_Boom_brake_descender_on_second_tang_06.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100434\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A second boom tang secures a climbing descender which makes a highly effective boom brake</p></div>\n<h2>Control improvements</h2>\n<p>Over the years we’ve also added a Selden Rodkicker boom support system, several foot blocks, a boom brake, Tides Marine SailTrack and mainsail tack reefing lines, and have completely re-invented the mainsheet.</p>\n<p>The Rodkicker eliminates the need for a topping lift, while more footblocks allow control of the headsail sheet, reaching sheet, staysail sheet and boom brake lines with one cockpit winch per side. The boom brake protects against involuntary gybes, and lets them happen safely if they do occur.</p>\n<p>The SailTrack provides a low-friction slot for the new mainsail cars, simplifying and accelerating reefing operations. The tack reefing lines support reefing entirely from the cockpit, and the new mainsheet is now entirely outside the cockpit. The changes mean we now have a safer boat, having saved us from injury, and our boat from damage, on many occasions.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100433\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100433\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100433\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2a_New_footblocks_and_lines_05-630x355.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2a_New_footblocks_and_lines_05-630x355.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2a_New_footblocks_and_lines_05-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2a_New_footblocks_and_lines_05-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2a_New_footblocks_and_lines_05-1536x865.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2a_New_footblocks_and_lines_05.jpg 1771w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100433\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dual lockable foot blocks replaced the original single foot blocks on each side</p></div>\n<h2>Foot blocks</h2>\n<p>Initially, we had one non-lockable dual foot block on each side to lead lines to the cockpit coaming winches. They were sized for 14mm-plus lines, as required in the 1980s. Because we had a single winch on each coaming, only one line could be used at a time.</p>\n<p>We could run the second line across the cockpit to the windward winch, but that winch would usually belay (make fast) the checkstay (adjustable stay controlling mast bend). We wanted four 8-10mm lines each side (headsail sheet, reaching sheet, staysail sheet and boom brake).</p>\n<p>The reaching sheet runs through a toerail-mounted block to lead the headsail outboard – very useful for trade winds sailing. We also replaced each old dual foot block with two dual lockable foot blocks. This was a huge improvement. It meant we could trim one line, lock it, and swap another line onto the winch. The modification was vital for installing a boom brake. Our headsail sheets are 8mm polyester-sheathed Dyneema and the boom brake line is 10mm double-braid polyester.</p>\n<h2>Boom brake</h2>\n<p>Initially we had a single tang (metal strip) under the boom for the kicker. It had two holes allowing both a solid kicker and boom brake to be fitted. We used a shackle and short webbing strop to connect a mountaineering ‘figure of eight’ descender to the boom, with the webbing preventing metal-to-metal contact between the kicker and the descender.</p>\n<p>However, the solid kicker began to chaff the strop which required regular replacement. So, during a refit we had a second tang fitted aft of the original tang, with the solid kicker and boom brake sharing an extended backing plate. This solved the problem and greatly reinforced the boom.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100435\" style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100435\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100435\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2c_Double_reefed_trysail_size_mainsail_11-320x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2c_Double_reefed_trysail_size_mainsail_11-320x400.jpg 320w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2c_Double_reefed_trysail_size_mainsail_11-160x200.jpg 160w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2c_Double_reefed_trysail_size_mainsail_11-768x960.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2c_Double_reefed_trysail_size_mainsail_11-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2c_Double_reefed_trysail_size_mainsail_11-400x500.jpg 400w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.2c_Double_reefed_trysail_size_mainsail_11.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100435\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The double-reefed mainsail is no bigger than a trysail</p></div>\n<p>The boom brake works brilliantly. A single boom brake control line leads forward from a foot block to a block shackled to the toerail, up to and through the descender and down to the other side and aft to a foot block. The 10mm double-braid polyester puts some ‘elastic’ in the system.</p>\n<p>We always use the boom brake when sailing downwind, so it’s permanently rigged. To activate it, we simply take up any slack on the windward side and lock, then manually heave the leeward side tight and lock. No winching is required. If an accidental gybe occurs the boom moves across slowly.</p>\n<p>When we are preparing to gybe we unlock the old windward side and during the gybe the boom brake will effectively slow the boom as it swings across.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100436\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100436\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100436\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.3a_New_Kicker_3-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.3a_New_Kicker_3-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.3a_New_Kicker_3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.3a_New_Kicker_3.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100436\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Selden Rodkicker with an internal gas strut</p></div>\n<h2>Solid kicker</h2>\n<p>Changing to a solid kicker eliminated the need for a boom topping lift. The Selden Rodkicker’s internal gas strut pushes the boom up when we ease the kicker line. When reefing, this ‘scandalising’ of the mainsail removes leach tension, making clew line tensioning easy.</p>\n<h2>Mainsheet moved</h2>\n<p>Initially we had a conventional single mainsheet running from a cockpit-wide traveller. The traveller was on the bridge deck immediately aft of the companionway. These systems can be scary during intentional gybes and extremely dangerous during accidental gybes.</p>\n<p>During a refit we had the traveller removed and added a stainless steel arch with mounts for two mainsheets – one on either side.

We placed the arch such that the sprayhood extended further aft, greatly improving the shelter it provides. The feet of the two tubes are splayed apart for strength, with a large baseplate between. The arch is bolted through the cockpit coamings with massive backing plates below.</p>\n<h2>Reefing tack lines</h2>\n<p>For safety reasons we wanted to be able to reef from the cockpit, which meant adding tack lines and modifying the mast gooseneck. The old gooseneck had conventional open hooks for mainsail luff reefing cringles. We needed closed rings through which we could lead tack lines. From there each tackline could run down to the deck and aft via deck organisers to coachroof clutch and winch.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100439\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100439\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100439\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.3d_New_gooseneck_fitting_with_tack_line_rings_10-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.3d_New_gooseneck_fitting_with_tack_line_rings_10-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.3d_New_gooseneck_fitting_with_tack_line_rings_10-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.3d_New_gooseneck_fitting_with_tack_line_rings_10-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.3d_New_gooseneck_fitting_with_tack_line_rings_10-1536x863.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/02/YAM310.gear_tech.3d_New_gooseneck_fitting_with_tack_line_rings_10.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100439\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A new stainless steel gooseneck allows Mike to reef the mainsail from the cockpit</p></div>\n<p>During a refit we had a new stainless steel gooseneck fabricated.

The tack lines attach to the D-rings which can’t get through the gooseneck rings. Our mainsail has only two reef points since it is first-reef size (i.e. not full hoist). We can fully reef the mainsail with our two sets of tack and clew lines. The second reef is trysail-sized. The reefing lines are double-braid polyester – 8mm for tack and 10mm for clew.</p>\n<h2>Luff track</h2>\n<p>The most recent modification that we have made to <em>Zen Again</em> has been to successfully install a Tides Marine SailTrack. Previously our mainsail luff had cars and slugs which fed up the mast’s extruded slot.

The SailTrack simply slides up the extruded mast slot and is permanently secured in place.</p>\n<p>Instead of the mainsail cars/slugs working in the 38-year-old mast slot they now work in a low-friction plastic slot. The SailTrack has transformed our mainsail handling as the sail now hoists easily and literally falls down. The tack line’s purpose now is to hold the reef tack down – it’s barely needed to haul down the tack.

A preventer holds the boom forward using a long line from the end of the boom, forward to a turning block, then back to a clutch or jammer in the cockpit.</p>\n<p>If you plan to intentionally gybe with a single preventer, you’re unlikely to want to go all the way forward to re-rig it, which means you’ll need two preventers, one for each side – a cumbersome solution that can lead to lines getting caught.</p>\n<p>If your preventer fails to do its job, the ensuing accidental gybe can be dramatic and dangerous. I’ve known many boats that have had mainsheet, traveller or boom broken by gybes when the preventer failed. Even if nothing breaks, the boat will pirouette – because the main is pinned to one side by the preventer – putting a huge load on the rudder.</p>\n<p>A boom brake, meanwhile, uses friction created by lines to slow down the swing of the boom. The amount of friction applied to the swing is controlled by the number of turns you take around a central hub on the boom.</p>\n<p>Boom brakes do not necessarily require a large change of course when gybing. We simply release the old windward side of the boom brake, turn downwind, winch in the main, gybe, ease the mainsheet, and then lock the boom brake.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Enjoyed reading this?<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-76661\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/02/CLEANYAM260.cover_-143x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"143\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/02/CLEANYAM260.cover_-143x200.jpg 143w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/02/CLEANYAM260.cover_-287x400.jpg 287w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/02/CLEANYAM260.cover_-768x1071.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/02/CLEANYAM260.cover_-1101x1536.jpg 1101w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/02/CLEANYAM260.cover_-1468x2048.jpg 1468w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/02/CLEANYAM260.cover_-358x500.jpg 358w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/02/CLEANYAM260.cover_.jpg 1524w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 143px) 100vw, 143px\" /></h2>\n<p><em>A subscription to Yachting Monthly magazine costs around 40% less than the cover price, <strong>so you can save money compared to buying single issues</strong>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Print and digital editions <a href=\"https://www.magazinesdirect.com/az-magazines/34207741/yachting-monthly-subscription.thtml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">are available through Magazines Direct &#8211; where you <strong>can also find the latest deals</strong></a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>YM is packed with information to help you get the most from your time on the water.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li><em>Take your seamanship to the next level with tips, advice and skills from our experts</em></li>\n<li><em>Impartial in-depth reviews of the latest yachts and equipment</em></li>\n<li><em>Cruising guides to help you reach those dream destinations</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Follow us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/yachtingmonthlymag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a>, <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/yachtingmonthly\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/yachtingmonthlymag/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram.</a></strong></em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/sailing-skills/how-these-mainsail-modifications-revolutionised-by-yachts-performance-100429\">How these mainsail modifications revolutionised my yacht&#8217;s performance</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com\">Yachting Monthly</a>.</p>\n",
    "content:encodedSnippet": "Safety and performance improved hugely when Mike Reynolds reduced the size of his mainsail and re-configured the systems controlling it \n\r\n\n\nOur 1980s Yamazaki Yachts 34, Zen Again, is an IOR (International Offshore Rule) 3/4 tonner masthead cutter, with a fin keel and a skeg-hung rudder, displacing 6,000kg loaded for blue-water cruising. When we purchased her in 2010 she had a full-sized mainsail, conventional mainsheet and traveller, a simple rope kicker, two mainsail clew reefing lines, and ‘slugs in mast slot’ mainsail luff attachment.\nShe was designed for fully crewed racing and we quickly found that the main issue with the mainsail systems was safety. The full-sized mainsail may have been good for light airs whilst racing with four crew on the rail, but it was just too big for cruising.\nThe mainsheet and traveller were in the cockpit, creating a ‘death-zone’ during gybes. The rope kicker required a boom topping lift which proved to be a nuisance, and reefing without tack lines necessitated work at the mast. The mainsail luff attachment was difficult to reef due to the slugs jamming. In short, she was just too hazardous for two-handed cruising.\nShe is very easily driven, so slowing her down is often our primary concern at sea. With the original mainsail, we very rarely set the full sail. This meant that one of the reefing lines was always in use and putting in the third reef required re-reeving the first reef line.\nSo, when the time finally came for a new mainsail we had it made with the first-reef luff length and two deep reef points.\nUpwind the new sail works well in light breezes. A notable example would be the time when we sailed 600 miles to windward in 10-15 knots from Panama to Jamaica – and would have left most displacement 40ft cruisers in our wake!\nBroad-reaching with the new sail and our 130% yankee will give us boat speeds of five knots in 6-8 knots apparent – a 120-mile daily average and perfectly respectable for our little cruiser. It’s fair to say that our new smaller main has certainly been a huge improvement.\n\nA second boom tang secures a climbing descender which makes a highly effective boom brake\n\nControl improvements\nOver the years we’ve also added a Selden Rodkicker boom support system, several foot blocks, a boom brake, Tides Marine SailTrack and mainsail tack reefing lines, and have completely re-invented the mainsheet.\nThe Rodkicker eliminates the need for a topping lift, while more footblocks allow control of the headsail sheet, reaching sheet, staysail sheet and boom brake lines with one cockpit winch per side. The boom brake protects against involuntary gybes, and lets them happen safely if they do occur.\nThe SailTrack provides a low-friction slot for the new mainsail cars, simplifying and accelerating reefing operations. The tack reefing lines support reefing entirely from the cockpit, and the new mainsheet is now entirely outside the cockpit. The changes mean we now have a safer boat, having saved us from injury, and our boat from damage, on many occasions.\n\nDual lockable foot blocks replaced the original single foot blocks on each side\n\nFoot blocks\nInitially, we had one non-lockable dual foot block on each side to lead lines to the cockpit coaming winches. They were sized for 14mm-plus lines, as required in the 1980s. Because we had a single winch on each coaming, only one line could be used at a time.\nWe could run the second line across the cockpit to the windward winch, but that winch would usually belay (make fast) the checkstay (adjustable stay controlling mast bend). We wanted four 8-10mm lines each side (headsail sheet, reaching sheet, staysail sheet and boom brake).\nThe reaching sheet runs through a toerail-mounted block to lead the headsail outboard – very useful for trade winds sailing. We also replaced each old dual foot block with two dual lockable foot blocks. This was a huge improvement. It meant we could trim one line, lock it, and swap another line onto the winch. The modification was vital for installing a boom brake. Our headsail sheets are 8mm polyester-sheathed Dyneema and the boom brake line is 10mm double-braid polyester.\nBoom brake\nInitially we had a single tang (metal strip) under the boom for the kicker. It had two holes allowing both a solid kicker and boom brake to be fitted. We used a shackle and short webbing strop to connect a mountaineering ‘figure of eight’ descender to the boom, with the webbing preventing metal-to-metal contact between the kicker and the descender.\nHowever, the solid kicker began to chaff the strop which required regular replacement. So, during a refit we had a second tang fitted aft of the original tang, with the solid kicker and boom brake sharing an extended backing plate. This solved the problem and greatly reinforced the boom.\n\nThe double-reefed mainsail is no bigger than a trysail\n\nThe boom brake works brilliantly. A single boom brake control line leads forward from a foot block to a block shackled to the toerail, up to and through the descender and down to the other side and aft to a foot block. The 10mm double-braid polyester puts some ‘elastic’ in the system.\nWe always use the boom brake when sailing downwind, so it’s permanently rigged. To activate it, we simply take up any slack on the windward side and lock, then manually heave the leeward side tight and lock. No winching is required. If an accidental gybe occurs the boom moves across slowly.\nWhen we are preparing to gybe we unlock the old windward side and during the gybe the boom brake will effectively slow the boom as it swings across.\n\nThe Selden Rodkicker with an internal gas strut\n\nSolid kicker\nChanging to a solid kicker eliminated the need for a boom topping lift. The Selden Rodkicker’s internal gas strut pushes the boom up when we ease the kicker line. When reefing, this ‘scandalising’ of the mainsail removes leach tension, making clew line tensioning easy.\nMainsheet moved\nInitially we had a conventional single mainsheet running from a cockpit-wide traveller. The traveller was on the bridge deck immediately aft of the companionway. These systems can be scary during intentional gybes and extremely dangerous during accidental gybes.\nDuring a refit we had the traveller removed and added a stainless steel arch with mounts for two mainsheets – one on either side. From a 2:1 tackle each mainsheet is led forward to the gooseneck, down to the deck and back to the coachroof clutch and winch.\n\nClear cockpit with the mainsheet control system now totally out of the way\n\nWhen sailing upwind the windward sheet acts as a traveller and the leeward sheet and the kicker itself act as dual kickers. When gybing, the mainsheet falls go through above the sprayhood well clear of the cockpit – so much safer.\nThe arch comprises dual 38mm-diameter, interconnected tubes with the forward tube securing the sprayhood and the aft tube providing a handhold. We placed the arch such that the sprayhood extended further aft, greatly improving the shelter it provides. The feet of the two tubes are splayed apart for strength, with a large baseplate between. The arch is bolted through the cockpit coamings with massive backing plates below.\nReefing tack lines\nFor safety reasons we wanted to be able to reef from the cockpit, which meant adding tack lines and modifying the mast gooseneck. The old gooseneck had conventional open hooks for mainsail luff reefing cringles. We needed closed rings through which we could lead tack lines. From there each tackline could run down to the deck and aft via deck organisers to coachroof clutch and winch.\n\nA new stainless steel gooseneck allows Mike to reef the mainsail from the cockpit\n\nDuring a refit we had a new stainless steel gooseneck fabricated. It is a thing of beauty and does the job very well.\nOur mainsail has webbing strops through each luff reef cringle with D-rings at each end. The tack lines attach to the D-rings which can’t get through the gooseneck rings. Our mainsail has only two reef points since it is first-reef size (i.e. not full hoist). We can fully reef the mainsail with our two sets of tack and clew lines. The second reef is trysail-sized. The reefing lines are double-braid polyester – 8mm for tack and 10mm for clew.\nLuff track\nThe most recent modification that we have made to Zen Again has been to successfully install a Tides Marine SailTrack. Previously our mainsail luff had cars and slugs which fed up the mast’s extruded slot. This worked quite well but it often required winching the luff down via the tack lines.\nWhen we were reefing the full-length batten cars pushed forward and jammed even with wind out of the sail.\n\nThe SailTrack’s low friction plastic slot makes hoisting and lowering the mainsail much easier\n\nLow friction\nWe fitted the SailTrack when we replaced the mainsail, which meant we were able to have the sail constructed to suit. Fitting the SailTrack was simple with the mast out of the boat for a refit, but it can be done with the mast stepped. The SailTrack simply slides up the extruded mast slot and is permanently secured in place.\nInstead of the mainsail cars/slugs working in the 38-year-old mast slot they now work in a low-friction plastic slot. The SailTrack has transformed our mainsail handling as the sail now hoists easily and literally falls down. The tack line’s purpose now is to hold the reef tack down – it’s barely needed to haul down the tack. We still release the kicker and luff the sail during these operations.\n\nDyneema cord and soft-attach blocks are strong and quiet\n\nSoft attach blocks\nFor the mainsheets and other purposes we use Harken soft-attach blocks. These use 3mm Dyneema cord. We’ve used them across several oceans, replacing the cord every couple of years to avoid UV-induced failure. We still use stainless shackles on toerail-attached blocks due to the toerail’s rough inside edges.\nSo, after a decade of optimisation we now have a mainsail handling system that works flawlessly. Some of the modifications weren’t cheap but they have all made sailing safer and more fun.\n\nInstall a boom brake to slow the boom’s swing during a gybe\n\nPreventer or boom brake?\nWhen sailing downwind you may want to set a boom preventer or boom brake to eliminate the risk of an accidental gybe. A preventer holds the boom forward using a long line from the end of the boom, forward to a turning block, then back to a clutch or jammer in the cockpit.\nIf you plan to intentionally gybe with a single preventer, you’re unlikely to want to go all the way forward to re-rig it, which means you’ll need two preventers, one for each side – a cumbersome solution that can lead to lines getting caught.\nIf your preventer fails to do its job, the ensuing accidental gybe can be dramatic and dangerous. I’ve known many boats that have had mainsheet, traveller or boom broken by gybes when the preventer failed. Even if nothing breaks, the boat will pirouette – because the main is pinned to one side by the preventer – putting a huge load on the rudder.\nA boom brake, meanwhile, uses friction created by lines to slow down the swing of the boom. The amount of friction applied to the swing is controlled by the number of turns you take around a central hub on the boom.\nBoom brakes do not necessarily require a large change of course when gybing. We simply release the old windward side of the boom brake, turn downwind, winch in the main, gybe, ease the mainsheet, and then lock the boom brake.\nEnjoyed reading this?\nA subscription to Yachting Monthly magazine costs around 40% less than the cover price, so you can save money compared to buying single issues.\nPrint and digital editions are available through Magazines Direct – where you can also find the latest deals.\nYM is packed with information to help you get the most from your time on the water.\nTake your seamanship to the next level with tips, advice and skills from our experts\nImpartial in-depth reviews of the latest yachts and equipment\nCruising guides to help you reach those dream destinations\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nThe post How these mainsail modifications revolutionised my yacht’s performance appeared first on Yachting Monthly.",

I wanted to be sure we reserved a specific date as we had guests joining us for the transit and their schedule didn’t give us much flexibility.</p>\n<p>The website requires you to upload photos of your boat from various angles. It’s glitchy and slow, and I had to make a few calls to the helpline to get it to work. In some ways, the site was harder to navigate than the canal itself.</p>\n<p>In the past, the only option to pay for the trip was depositing a chunk of cash at a bank in a sketchy neighborhood of Colón, with expensive ATM fees. It is now possible to do it by bank transfer, but because many retail banks have restrictions on sending money to Panama, ASEM provides details for a bouncing money transfer which routes money via New York.</p>\n<p>I found a simpler and cheaper way was to use my Wise account, an online bank and exchange service, that can transfer cash directly to the Panamanian account. ASEM doesn’t publish the full details of this account, and getting it took a few more calls.</p>\n<p>The cost of the transit is just over $3,000 USD for any boat under 65ft. However, you get about $1,000 back two months later if you don’t cause any delays or need assistance in the canal.</p>\n<p>The new system means there’s very little reason to use an agent anymore. Once paid up, we uploaded the receipt to the website and the next day called the scheduling department to confirm our date.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100424\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100424\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100424\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_panama_canal.24_IMG_20240121_WA0045-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_panama_canal.24_IMG_20240121_WA0045-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_panama_canal.24_IMG_20240121_WA0045-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_panama_canal.24_IMG_20240121_WA0045-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_panama_canal.24_IMG_20240121_WA0045-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_panama_canal.24_IMG_20240121_WA0045.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100424\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andy and Julie transited the canal with a crew ranging in ages from 3 to 75</p></div>\n<h2>Ready and waiting</h2>\n<p>A few days before the transit, we arrived in Shelter Bay Marina to prep for the journey.</p>\n<p>There’s an anchorage just outside called The Flats, but in practical terms, the marina charges so much for mooring a dinghy and picking up passengers that it’s a false economy not to come in for at least one or two days despite their high prices.</p>\n<p>There’s a fantastic WhatsApp group managed by a couple of long-stay residents. Useful items are advertised, usually at bargain prices, and a wealth of great information is shared on where to source everything from flares to flags to fridges.</p>\n<p>Cruisers also organise a weekly barbecue and evening sundowners.

As you’ll need fuel to motor for about 15 hours through the canal, it’s good to plan ahead.</p>\n<p>The other thing we needed to pick up were lines and fenders. ASEM stipulates that each boat needs four hefty lines of a given length and diameter. We rented these along with four large fenders from one of the agents. Stanley delivered them to our boat in the marina, and they were easy to drop off at Playita Marina the day after our transit.</p>\n<p>You also need four line handlers to manage the lines as the boat rises and falls in the locks, but two days before they were due to join us, the Campbell family was snowed in with canceled flights from the US.</p>\n<p>They were able to rebook, arriving 24 hours late. I called the canal scheduler and was amazed to find that not only was there space on the next day, but we would be the only boat on that day.

Rafted boats only need two active line handlers each, and a boat in the middle of the raft doesn’t need any. I’d counted on only needing two active line handlers, but now we’d need four.</p>\n<p>Using the WhatsApp group, I was able to find a dock-walker, Lorena, to join us, and Melvin from the Campbell family eagerly volunteered to do the fourth corner, notwithstanding his 75 years and slender frame.

Sometimes boats are sent through in one day with a 0400 start.</p>\n<p>We met Eduardo, our adviser, whose role is like a pilot for yachts.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Transiting the Panama canal was an epic milestone for Andy and Julie Pag. It required practical seamanship, bureaucratic navigation and help from onboard guests\n\nThe journey started two months before our transit date, logging on to the website of the canal’s Small Craft Service, ASEM, to register the boat and request a transit date. I wanted to be sure we reserved a specific date as we had guests joining us for the transit and their schedule didn’t give us much flexibility.\nThe website requires you to upload photos of your boat from various angles. It’s glitchy and slow, and I had to make a few calls to the helpline to get it to work. In some ways, the site was harder to navigate than the canal itself.\nIn the past, the only option to pay for the trip was depositing a chunk of cash at a bank in a sketchy neighborhood of Colón, with expensive ATM fees. It is now possible to do it by bank transfer, but because many retail banks have restrictions on sending money to Panama, ASEM provides details for a bouncing money transfer which routes money via New York.\nI found a simpler and cheaper way was to use my Wise account, an online bank and exchange service, that can transfer cash directly to the Panamanian account. ASEM doesn’t publish the full details of this account, and getting it took a few more calls.\nThe cost of the transit is just over $3,000 USD for any boat under 65ft. However, you get about $1,000 back two months later if you don’t cause any delays or need assistance in the canal.\nThe new system means there’s very little reason to use an agent anymore. Once paid up, we uploaded the receipt to the website and the next day called the scheduling department to confirm our date.\n\nAndy and Julie transited the canal with a crew ranging in ages from 3 to 75\n\nReady and waiting\nA few days before the transit, we arrived in Shelter Bay Marina to prep for the journey.\nThere’s an anchorage just outside called The Flats, but in practical terms, the marina charges so much for mooring a dinghy and picking up passengers that it’s a false economy not to come in for at least one or two days despite their high prices.\nThere’s a fantastic WhatsApp group managed by a couple of long-stay residents. Useful items are advertised, usually at bargain prices, and a wealth of great information is shared on where to source everything from flares to flags to fridges.\nCruisers also organise a weekly barbecue and evening sundowners. The marina is set in the forest and bathed with the sound of howler monkeys and birdsong. One of the security guards, Carlos, runs a guided nature walk where it’s not unusual to see sloths.\nHowever, it’s far from anywhere, so there’s a twice-daily, free shuttle bus into Colón, and this was our chance to do a big provisioning run for the Pacific transit.\n\nWash inside the lock can make holding position challenging\n\nThe water and electricity at the marina were irregular, and I heard complaints about bad fuel, both diesel and petrol, from the fuel dock. As you’ll need fuel to motor for about 15 hours through the canal, it’s good to plan ahead.\nThe other thing we needed to pick up were lines and fenders. ASEM stipulates that each boat needs four hefty lines of a given length and diameter. We rented these along with four large fenders from one of the agents. Stanley delivered them to our boat in the marina, and they were easy to drop off at Playita Marina the day after our transit.\nYou also need four line handlers to manage the lines as the boat rises and falls in the locks, but two days before they were due to join us, the Campbell family was snowed in with canceled flights from the US.\nThey were able to rebook, arriving 24 hours late. I called the canal scheduler and was amazed to find that not only was there space on the next day, but we would be the only boat on that day. January is typically the high season for yacht transits.\n\nDavid advises Julie on the route as she helms through the canal\n\nBoats usually go through in pairs or trios, rafted together. Ironically, the other two boats due to raft with us on the 18th also rescheduled for different reasons. Being alone in the lock presented a new problem. Rafted boats only need two active line handlers each, and a boat in the middle of the raft doesn’t need any. I’d counted on only needing two active line handlers, but now we’d need four.\nUsing the WhatsApp group, I was able to find a dock-walker, Lorena, to join us, and Melvin from the Campbell family eagerly volunteered to do the fourth corner, notwithstanding his 75 years and slender frame. Other skippers from the WhatsApp group often make willing volunteers too, as it’s a good way for them to prepare for the transit with their own boat.\n\nYachts share locks with enormous cargo vessels\n\nMaking a start\nThe day before the transit, the scheduler confirmed we’d be on a two-day passage, spending one night in the lake tied up to a buoy just after the Gatun locks. Sometimes boats are sent through in one day with a 0400 start.\nWe met Eduardo, our adviser, whose role is like a pilot for yachts. As we motored under the Atlantic Bridge towards the locks, we could see the Barrington Island, a refrigerated container ship, hauling up its anchor and starting its turn into the channel behind us.\nThis would be our first lock buddy in the three consecutive locks up to Gatun Lake. We slid over to the side of the channel as 600ft of steel hull glided past us and was maneuvered by a tug into the lock ahead of us. As we followed it in, two canal workers from either side launched thin lines to us propelled by monkey fists as hard as cricket balls.\n\nThe Gaillard Cut was dynamited through the surrounding hills to create the canal\n\nI’d covered the solar panels with a spare mattress to protect them, and we signaled for them to throw to the front of the boat. I saw a large target wall used by them to practice their throws, but despite this, their lines went everywhere and almost broke a hatch.\nThe next day, one guy managed to miss the boat completely to the howls of laughter from his colleagues, even though I’d motored over to his side of the lock to make his throw easier. Our line handlers tied Stanley’s thick blue ropes on with recently learned bowlines, and the workers pulled them up and fastened them to the high dock wall.\nAs the water level rose, their job was to pull in the lines to keep the boat central. It’s an easy task with just the width of one boat to manage, but with a raft of three, it’s important to watch the line on the opposite side and work in tandem. The water level rises slowly at first as it equalizes with its counter-lock and then faster as it floods from the lake, but the whole process is leisurely.\nIt was dark by the time we exited the first three locks into the lake. This is the highest our boat has ever been. Eduardo guided us to the buoy and organized the fenders and lines for the side-tie process, something I’d never seen before.\n\nSwimming isn’t allowed in the lake, and there are crocodiles, but people often take the risk and jump into the fresh water once the adviser has left.\nAcross the river\nThe next morning, after a relaxed breakfast, a different adviser, David, joined us and we started the four-hour motor across the lake sticking tight to the starboard side of the channel as we passed and were overtaken by huge ships carrying the world’s produce back and forth. We weren’t allowed to sail, but with 14 knots of wind behind us we managed 7 knots at an easy 2,000rpm.\nWe had an early lunch on the move and matched our speed to the progress of Red Diamond, a bulk carrier who started the day in the Caribbean Sea and would be our lock buddy on the way down into the Pacific.

In many places this is simply impossible unless you own a superyacht. I often get ‘berth anxiety’ when in these places, so I would imagine others do too.

Lu Heikell considers overcrowding of anchorages \nIn and around the calanques were \nmany small open sportsboats like this \none, usually chartered for day trips\nWhen researching ports and anchorages to include in our pilot books, Rod and I tend to spend a lot of our time in some of the most popular places, making sure to make a note of any changes to the harbour layout, including any new services or extra pontoons.\nIt is no secret that the Ionian is one of the busiest sailing areas on the planet, with the Argo-Saronic not far behind. The Virgin Islands would also fall into this category. The combination of fair sailing breezes, myriad options to anchor or moor at convenient distances make it attractive both for charter companies and private yachts, and rightly so.\nOf course over the years things have changed, boat numbers have multiplied, and facilities and services improved immeasurably for all sailing visitors. Local people have adapted to the business this has brought and gained from the numbers of yacht-borne visitors.\nThis growth in yacht numbers has brought challenges though. Sailors are now sometimes in the position where, in order to secure a berth, they must either arrive around lunchtime or book ahead.\nArriving early compromises your sailing time, which in the Ionian often means motoring to arrive at your destination.\nArticle continues below…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n‘The day the sky turned red’ – Lu Heikell encounters an unusual phenomenon\nSaharan dust being blown across the Mediterranean is not a new phenomenon, but here it usually arrives in the form…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n‘Sardines cook over charcoal, sea shanties are sung and cider is swigged’ – Lu Heikell\nThere is a narrow street leading up from Port du Rosmeur to the town centre of Douarnenez, in the Finisterre…\n\n\nBooking ahead is obviously a preferable solution, but can come at quite a cost. In many places this is simply impossible unless you own a superyacht. I often get ‘berth anxiety’ when in these places, so I would imagine others do too. Of course those familiar with an area will have found the off-the-beaten-track spots, and will be unbothered by crowds.\nBut those on a one-week holiday are far more constrained by the distance they can venture from their base, and many of these places also remain popular with others who could easily sail off to more remote locations, but prefer not to.\nConsequently the most popular places, like, for example, the northern Ionian, become very busy.

Navigator’s notebooks have blank and lined pages for this reason, so sketch maps are not a new idea.</p>\n<p>However, I think a slight adjustment to the theme adds real benefit and ease, even when most of us navigate primarily from our on-deck chart plotters, although the rationale may be slightly different to what it once was.</p>\n<p>The Royal Marines (and the Army) still make three-dimensional models of the area on the map they will be going to when giving ‘Orders’ (military instructions; look online for ‘model pit’ to see what I mean) as it’s a good way to get everyone orientated.</p>\n<h2>Three-dimensional thinking</h2>\n<p>What I found was that if I ever had to make the model (which we had to do often on leadership courses), the topography of what I created out of mud and coloured bits of ribbon often stayed in my head for a surprisingly long time. My take away wasn’t that a three-dimensional model stays in your head longer than a two-dimensional map; but rather it was the physical act of making the model that embedded the topography into my brain as a byproduct of what I was doing.</p>\n<p>So for me, the real benefit of making a pilotage plan sketch map is not really in the product (the sketch map). It is in the making of it. I would say 70% of the benefit comes from going through the motions of making it and just 30% in the sheet of paper at the end with the detail on it.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100349\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100349\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100349\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.03_2XM2BR8-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.03_2XM2BR8-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.03_2XM2BR8-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.03_2XM2BR8-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.03_2XM2BR8-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.03_2XM2BR8.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100349\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Salcombe makes a lovely harbour that isn’t too difficult, but getting in over the bar still demands respect.

Sometimes it can only be as far as the edge of the screen.</p>\n<p>You can often get away with only working this far ahead much of the time, and people do, but it does have its drawbacks. First you are ‘fixed’ to the chart plotter needing to check where you are all of the time as a new bit of the route comes into view (as poor navigators used to do bobbing up and down to the chart table continuously). If I do this, I also find I need to scroll backwards and forwards to look ahead and then back to check that my position is still ok.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100350\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100350\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100350\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.07_4_Step_1_Reading_the_Pilot_Book-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.07_4_Step_1_Reading_the_Pilot_Book-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.07_4_Step_1_Reading_the_Pilot_Book-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.07_4_Step_1_Reading_the_Pilot_Book-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.07_4_Step_1_Reading_the_Pilot_Book-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.07_4_Step_1_Reading_the_Pilot_Book.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100350\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Read the pilot book to get your head around the big picture and the details you need to pay attention to</p></div>\n<h2>Create a detailed mind map</h2>\n<p>As probably the most capable person onboard, if I am glued to the chartplotter, the wheel, or sometimes both, I can’t lend a hand when it may be better for the management of the boat that I do so. I find this frustrating and stressful.</p>\n<p>One way to mitigate this is by meticulously scrutinising what is on my route line as I plot it so I know it is always safe. However, this does reduce my flexibility as I may be reluctant to deviate from the safety it provides. In open water this strategy works. In congested areas it may not because, as we sit at the bottom of the COLREGs pecking order, we usually have to give way, often by having to turn towards shallower water. If you hadn’t planned for any deviation from your track, your bubble of awareness shrinks quickly and significantly and you are back to potentially being fixed to a screen and feeling anxious and stressed.</p>\n<p>In creating a more detailed sketch map with topographical elements, navigational marks, transits, your route and the tide heights, you’ll become aware of so much more information, and consequently a wider range of parameters in which you can operate. You can incorporate information from lots of sources to create as detail-rich a plan as you want.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the process of drawing things out and planning your route within it situates everything in relation to each other. This is even more helpful if it’s going to be a night entry.

This will help with the decision-making process of how you are going to route yourself into the port.

All marks are great reference points so do include them. Finally draw in your direction / route lines with arrows and include bearings.</p>\n<p>These lines are really useful to orientate you to the direction you will need go at each subsequent turn, or even to look, which sometimes might not be as obvious as you think. Remember, while a chartplotter might suggest the fastest route, you might choose a slightly longer one with straight courses and sharp corners so that you can use a fixed headmark, transit, an easy compass bearing (nearest 5º), or to jump from one buoy to the next.</p>\n<p>It is so much easier to orientate yourself and stay on track if your actual route is defined by what you can see in the real world rather than a wiggly line on a virtual screen.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100358\" style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100358\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100358\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.15_12_I_dont_reuse_plans_The_process_has_more_value_than_the_product-320x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.15_12_I_dont_reuse_plans_The_process_has_more_value_than_the_product-320x400.jpg 320w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.15_12_I_dont_reuse_plans_The_process_has_more_value_than_the_product-160x200.jpg 160w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.15_12_I_dont_reuse_plans_The_process_has_more_value_than_the_product-768x960.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.15_12_I_dont_reuse_plans_The_process_has_more_value_than_the_product-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.15_12_I_dont_reuse_plans_The_process_has_more_value_than_the_product-400x500.jpg 400w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.15_12_I_dont_reuse_plans_The_process_has_more_value_than_the_product.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100358\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Justin never reuses old sketch maps, as details such as tidal height can dramatically change your plan, and the process of thinking things through is the important part of the exercise</p></div>\n<h2>Calculate ahead of time</h2>\n<p>One key rule I follow is, whatever is on my sketch map page must be immediately useful and not require me to have to do ‘something’ with it.

I’m not too worried about that because I can tack and head away on a reach, but it’s still a negative to count.</p>\n<p>The other option is to harden up and try and hit the transit before the bar. The positives are it’s a simpler sail for longer. The negative is I won’t be able to see the transit for quite a while so could do with some boundary lines to funnel me towards the right place to cross the bar.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100361\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100361\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100361\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.19_24_Route_Options_on_the_Approach_Chart-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.19_24_Route_Options_on_the_Approach_Chart-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.19_24_Route_Options_on_the_Approach_Chart-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.19_24_Route_Options_on_the_Approach_Chart-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.19_24_Route_Options_on_the_Approach_Chart-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.19_24_Route_Options_on_the_Approach_Chart.jpg 1641w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100361\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">There’s no harm in getting onto a transit as early as possible for simplicity, but it might not be the most elegant solution</p></div>\n<h2>Funnelling in</h2>\n<p>The eastern side of the bay is reasonably clear with all hazards within 500m of, what is on this day, the windward shore.

A parallel course of about 300° will take me in the right direction and if the depth shallows below 20m (plus tide), I’ll know I am being pushed too far north. Fortunately, I only have to bear away to get to deeper water.</p>\n<p>When I am due east of Bolt Head, the 20m contour veers off west and the water then shallows quite uniformly towards the bar.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100364\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100364\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100364\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.24_24a_Right_on_the_Transit_Paul_Gibbins_Photography_-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.24_24a_Right_on_the_Transit_Paul_Gibbins_Photography_-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.24_24a_Right_on_the_Transit_Paul_Gibbins_Photography_-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.24_24a_Right_on_the_Transit_Paul_Gibbins_Photography_-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.24_24a_Right_on_the_Transit_Paul_Gibbins_Photography_.jpg 1417w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100364\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Transits aren’t always easy to pick out, which is where pilot books can provide helpful advice and photos</p></div>\n<h2>Thinking Ahead</h2>\n<p>Due east of Bolt Head is also about the time I’ll be able to see the whole transit for the first time because the cliffs will have obscured my view of it until then.

The depth reduces gradually from 20m down towards 5m and it’s only at the 5m contour that I need to be careful. I can angle my way in, monitoring the depth and ideally try and judge it so I arrive on transit just before the bar. What is important is the transit isn’t my only reference point.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100362\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100362\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100362\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.22_23_National_Coastwatch_Institution_Prawle_Point_Paul_Gibbins_Photography_-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.22_23_National_Coastwatch_Institution_Prawle_Point_Paul_Gibbins_Photography_-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.22_23_National_Coastwatch_Institution_Prawle_Point_Paul_Gibbins_Photography_-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.22_23_National_Coastwatch_Institution_Prawle_Point_Paul_Gibbins_Photography_-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.22_23_National_Coastwatch_Institution_Prawle_Point_Paul_Gibbins_Photography_.jpg 1417w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100362\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The National Coastwatch Institute lookout at Prawle Point, to the west of Salcombe, is always happy to give you a radio check on VHF ch 65.

If I do get pushed off the transit to the right (east) between the bar and the red buoy, I need to be careful that I don’t get caught up in the rest of the bar (named ‘The Bar’ on the chartlet) on the eastern side. But how to identify if that’s happening? The Bar is just 40m from the transit which isn’t much (two boats passing each other can use up 20m).</p>\n<p>As the Bar’s depth is given as 1.5m and the 2m contour is defined north/south, I have a straight-forward depth boundary. I could just calculate the depth I would see if I crossed it and head to port (west) or slow down as necessary.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100365\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100365\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100365\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.25_25_Over_the_bar_Reference_Chart_-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.25_25_Over_the_bar_Reference_Chart_-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.25_25_Over_the_bar_Reference_Chart_-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.25_25_Over_the_bar_Reference_Chart_-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.25_25_Over_the_bar_Reference_Chart_-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.25_25_Over_the_bar_Reference_Chart_.jpg 1677w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100365\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Your sketch chart will help you know how much wiggle room you have to deviate.

As I will want to know when I am crossing over the main bar anyway, I am going to be watching the depth like a hawk. As the two bar depths are so similar (within 10cm), and, assuming they haven’t changed, all I need to do is note the shallowest depth I see when I cross the main bar and note that height.</p>\n<p>What’s better is I’m using the actual height of tide at the time rather than the predicted height.

All of that boils down to: between the (outer) bar and the first red buoy, I don’t want to let the depth get any lower than the shallowest depth I saw when I crossed the bar – deeper water will always be towards the transit.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100368\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100368\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100368\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.28_27_Salcombe_Looking_East_Through_the_marked_channel_Chart-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.28_27_Salcombe_Looking_East_Through_the_marked_channel_Chart-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.28_27_Salcombe_Looking_East_Through_the_marked_channel_Chart-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.28_27_Salcombe_Looking_East_Through_the_marked_channel_Chart-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.28_27_Salcombe_Looking_East_Through_the_marked_channel_Chart-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.28_27_Salcombe_Looking_East_Through_the_marked_channel_Chart.jpg 1948w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100368\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some plotter apps, like TimeZero’s TZiBoat, let you spin your view and use 3D elevations to make visualising the pilotage much easier</p></div>\n<h2>Making the Turn</h2>\n<p>Looking roughly 055° from the first (most southerly) red buoy, there should be a line of green buoys over to the right marking the right-hand side of the channel as it turns north-east. The chart also gives a leading light bearing of 042.5° which is actually on the wrong side of the channel for entering the harbour.</p>\n<p>The bearing is fine, just not the ground track. As I’ll need to stay right to keep to the correct side of the channel anyway, it’ll pay to try and leave the transit as soon as I can and cross to hug the green buoys. I’ll want to avoid staying on the transit too long and for a line of boats to feel it’s ok to cut the corner and go between me and the greens and stop me crossing over.</p>\n<p>The other important thing to note is the channel isn’t very wide and there are a few nasty-looking drying rocks close to the channel edges. It’s worth making sure they are all marked on my sketch map so I have a good idea of the detail.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100370\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100370\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100370\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.30_28_Bass_Rock_just_north_of_first_red_buoy_Photo-630x355.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.30_28_Bass_Rock_just_north_of_first_red_buoy_Photo-630x355.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.30_28_Bass_Rock_just_north_of_first_red_buoy_Photo-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.30_28_Bass_Rock_just_north_of_first_red_buoy_Photo-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.30_28_Bass_Rock_just_north_of_first_red_buoy_Photo-1536x865.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_EOB_pilotage.30_28_Bass_Rock_just_north_of_first_red_buoy_Photo.jpg 1654w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100370\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A quiet day afloat is easy, but even in calm conditions, lots of boat traffic can make staying on course and spotting buoys tricky</p></div>\n<h2>Into the (sea) ‘weeds’</h2>\n<p>From the chart, it looks like I must keep the very first red to port because it marks a big rock (+0.8m). Once the first starboard mark is due east (think in compass points which don’t change, as terms such as ‘off the beam’, ‘off the quarter’ change with boat angle), there is quite a bit of clear water to the north and west of the first red but it doesn’t have a clear boundary.</p>\n<p>I could use my noted shallowest bar depth here too if necessary. The closest rock I could hit in that area has the lower main red-and-white transit post sticking out of it which I’ll have already seen. There is also a rock between the first and second green buoys the other side of the 2m contour; and there is a little room between the second and third green buoy. Helpfully, the rock between them is marked by a fixed green and white post (so is absolutely on station).</p>\n<p>The final two marks in the channel are a red and white post and red buoy that I must not go north of on the other side of the channel, and that’s it.

It’s much harder to read and to follow than to work out for yourself. If nothing else, it will hopefully give you an idea of the level of detail I go into when entering an unfamiliar port or when doing a bit of tricky pilotage.</p>\n<p>Do give it a go, it works. Also don’t forget, although your entry strategy and the sketch map can be used alone, you should also have a chart plotter, whether it’s on your phone, a tablet or a dedicated unit. What this process does is make you more aware of your surroundings and allows you to retain much more information.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Chartplotters are an amazing aid, but can detract from your real-world pilotage if not used with caution, says Justin Morton\n\nLong ago, in the days when paper charts were precious, navigators would sketch out the relevant details in their notebook and take it on deck rather than risk the chart getting damaged. Navigator’s notebooks have blank and lined pages for this reason, so sketch maps are not a new idea.\nHowever, I think a slight adjustment to the theme adds real benefit and ease, even when most of us navigate primarily from our on-deck chart plotters, although the rationale may be slightly different to what it once was.\nThe Royal Marines (and the Army) still make three-dimensional models of the area on the map they will be going to when giving ‘Orders’ (military instructions; look online for ‘model pit’ to see what I mean) as it’s a good way to get everyone orientated.\nThree-dimensional thinking\nWhat I found was that if I ever had to make the model (which we had to do often on leadership courses), the topography of what I created out of mud and coloured bits of ribbon often stayed in my head for a surprisingly long time. My take away wasn’t that a three-dimensional model stays in your head longer than a two-dimensional map; but rather it was the physical act of making the model that embedded the topography into my brain as a byproduct of what I was doing.\nSo for me, the real benefit of making a pilotage plan sketch map is not really in the product (the sketch map). It is in the making of it. I would say 70% of the benefit comes from going through the motions of making it and just 30% in the sheet of paper at the end with the detail on it.\n\nSalcombe makes a lovely harbour that isn’t too difficult, but getting in over the bar still demands respect. Photo: Maciej Olszewski / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nCrucially, for me, it is the least painful and most efficient way I know to learn an area sufficiently well enough to be able to make a really decent and well thought out pilotage plan.\nA problem with ‘chartplotter only’ navigation is your ‘bubble of awareness’ (a term described to me by someone well known to you all) can be very limited. Sometimes it can only be as far as the edge of the screen.\nYou can often get away with only working this far ahead much of the time, and people do, but it does have its drawbacks. First you are ‘fixed’ to the chart plotter needing to check where you are all of the time as a new bit of the route comes into view (as poor navigators used to do bobbing up and down to the chart table continuously). If I do this, I also find I need to scroll backwards and forwards to look ahead and then back to check that my position is still ok.\n\nRead the pilot book to get your head around the big picture and the details you need to pay attention to\n\nCreate a detailed mind map\nAs probably the most capable person onboard, if I am glued to the chartplotter, the wheel, or sometimes both, I can’t lend a hand when it may be better for the management of the boat that I do so. I find this frustrating and stressful.\nOne way to mitigate this is by meticulously scrutinising what is on my route line as I plot it so I know it is always safe. However, this does reduce my flexibility as I may be reluctant to deviate from the safety it provides. In open water this strategy works. In congested areas it may not because, as we sit at the bottom of the COLREGs pecking order, we usually have to give way, often by having to turn towards shallower water. If you hadn’t planned for any deviation from your track, your bubble of awareness shrinks quickly and significantly and you are back to potentially being fixed to a screen and feeling anxious and stressed.\nIn creating a more detailed sketch map with topographical elements, navigational marks, transits, your route and the tide heights, you’ll become aware of so much more information, and consequently a wider range of parameters in which you can operate. You can incorporate information from lots of sources to create as detail-rich a plan as you want.\nAdditionally, the process of drawing things out and planning your route within it situates everything in relation to each other. This is even more helpful if it’s going to be a night entry. It also embeds the detail into your brain well enough so that you don’t have to learn anything new once on the water, just be reminded of it.\n\nSketch or trace out the land, drying heights, rocks and navigational marks\n\nWhatever happens, your bubble of awareness stays at the far edges of what you’ve drawn on your page rather than what’s on the screen at the time.\nStarting your sketch map\nThe start point is the same as for any pilotage plan. It will take you a little longer, but probably no more than another five or 10 minutes. I always start with pilot books, a chart and increasingly the internet to look up harbour website information, and a growing number of apps also offer detailed advice.\nBeware that some of this information is ‘crowd-sourced’ and there of unknown provenance, while other, such as Imray’s Explorer app includes information from the pilot books and has been verified.\nIf you are lucky, a pilot book will have a suitably sized chartlet that you can trace around. I always trace because I am hopeless at drawing and you do need to get the perspective right or you’ll struggle to fit things into the right place. As I almost exclusively plan using electronic charts, I find that a piece of Perspex over my iPad screen stops the screen responding and the beauty of this is I can make what I am drawing match the size of my paper.\n\nUsing a tide app makes it easy to note down hourly or half-hourly tidal heights\n\nTrace the map\nFirst, I trace the land (it’s the easiest to match back up if the paper shifts). Then trace the drying contour lines, rocks, other natural hazards and put in buoys and marked transits, even if I don’t think they will be relevant to my plan.\nI include light characteristics if there is any chance it may get dark and include sector lights as they are usually visible in daylight and can be useful.\nKnow your limits\nI then go back and pick out the relevant depth contours (the ones closest to my draught + safety margin at the lowest height of tide at the time of pilotage) and draw them in. These are key because if I deviate from my intended route, it is this information that becomes very useful.\n\nYou may need more than one sketch to cover the detail of your approach and entry. They distill a lot of information very simply\n\nRemember, by doing this you are learning the lay-of-the-land and you’ll notice much more. This will help with the decision-making process of how you are going to route yourself into the port. You always want to be in a position when afloat to know whether, draught-wise, you can safely venture into a certain spot.\nPlan your route\nOnce I have the topographical information in place, I go on to plan my route to decide what I am going to use to navigate my way in, be it established marks or something I want to pick myself.\nA common limitation is to only put the navigational marks in that you plan to use. All marks are great reference points so do include them. Finally draw in your direction / route lines with arrows and include bearings.\nThese lines are really useful to orientate you to the direction you will need go at each subsequent turn, or even to look, which sometimes might not be as obvious as you think. Remember, while a chartplotter might suggest the fastest route, you might choose a slightly longer one with straight courses and sharp corners so that you can use a fixed headmark, transit, an easy compass bearing (nearest 5º), or to jump from one buoy to the next.\nIt is so much easier to orientate yourself and stay on track if your actual route is defined by what you can see in the real world rather than a wiggly line on a virtual screen.\n\nJustin never reuses old sketch maps, as details such as tidal height can dramatically change your plan, and the process of thinking things through is the important part of the exercise\n\nCalculate ahead of time\nOne key rule I follow is, whatever is on my sketch map page must be immediately useful and not require me to have to do ‘something’ with it. For instance I don’t include lats and longs because I’d have to plot them. I also always write tidal heights out at hourly intervals.\nIf I just had high and low water times and their heights referenced, I’ve got to do some calculations. It’s much easier to do the calculations ahead of time. I finish with any other relevant useful information that I might need to find in a hurry – VHF channels for the harbour and marina, expected tidal stream and so on.\nImagine the route\nThe final step is to have a good look at your sketch map and imagine yourself travelling through it from start to finish: effectively, create your plan and form a strategy on how you are going to enter the port. Don’t just think about navigation marks, the bearings between them and distances to travel.\n\nWalk through the route to check for any oversights. Adding colour can also help make sense of things quickly\n\nThink about how you can use anything and everything to provide you with extra help to know where you are. As you do it, add extra detail as necessary or make things a little more obvious if you need to. But don’t over do it – the more you add the less clear it will be. You want your sheet of paper to be able to quickly answer any questions you might have on the way in.\nImportantly, you want to develop an understanding of your options beforehand and at each stage know what you want to do. Often, once you’ve finished, it is surprising how straightforward everything will look and feel.\nWere anything to happen to your electronics you have a backup, but crucially it is just good seamanship not to rely on a single source of information. A spot depth and a compass bearing can confirm that you are where your plotter says you are.\n\nStart Point is one of the major headlands of the English Channel with the potential for serious overfalls. Photo: makasana photo / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nPutting it into practice in Salcombe\nFor this article we chose Salcombe. It is a popular destination and although only a few hours away, I hadn’t visited for a few years.\nI think the entry is quite interesting as it’s one of those ports where as long as you get the basics right, it’s pretty straightforward.\nSalcombe is known for its bar which is really only a problem (for most) around low water springs or in a strong southerly wind. There can also be strong currents in the channel which means a little extra focus is required when turning around and mooring up.\n\nA day sail from Dartmouth to Salcombe should be straightforward, but it’s still important to consider the impact of tidal height, stream, wind and other factors\n\nFrom Dartmouth, I have to pass the headland at Start Point, so it was timing this correctly that was the most important thing to get right on this trip. The entry time would have to adjust accordingly. As my trip was planned for a few days after neaps and with a light wind from the north east, the entry was going to be fine whatever time I arrived.\nRemember, the sketch map is really only just that, a map and a way to remember the topography. You still need to have a plan or strategy. For me, this usually splits into three parts: the approach from seaward, the detailed pilotage workings and finally, where I am going to moor up or anchor.\nI always start with the one that seems the trickiest (so I’m at my freshest). In this case I felt it was the part from the outer bar into the main channel but it’s laid out below in chronological order so it makes more sense.\n\nRounding Start Point can be calm as anything, but it can also be fierce for two or more miles out to sea\n\nApproach options\nWhen coming into the bay from the east I’ve got a couple of options. I can aim for the other headland (Bolt Head) until I pick up the prominent, well-documented transit (given as 000°) and turn north; or try and intersect it somewhere before I get to the bar. Distance-wise there isn’t much in it but there are pros and cons to both.\nContinuing towards Bolt-head, a light north-east wind keeps me on a broad reach, which is slow. Once I get to the transit, it’s unlikely that I’ll be able to sail north so I’ll be motoring (which does have it’s benefits because I’ll have less to do) but that’s the end of my sailing for the day.\nThe transit is also quite close to rocks and should my engine not start, I’m pretty close to a lee shore. I’m not too worried about that because I can tack and head away on a reach, but it’s still a negative to count.\nThe other option is to harden up and try and hit the transit before the bar. The positives are it’s a simpler sail for longer. The negative is I won’t be able to see the transit for quite a while so could do with some boundary lines to funnel me towards the right place to cross the bar.\n\nThere’s no harm in getting onto a transit as early as possible for simplicity, but it might not be the most elegant solution\n\nFunnelling in\nThe eastern side of the bay is reasonably clear with all hazards within 500m of, what is on this day, the windward shore. The tide is flooding – taking me north – and unfortunately I don’t know the rate. This is where the tide set and drift function on your instruments / plotter is useful but you need your log and heading sensor to be calibrated properly to be able to trust the readings.\nDistances are really hard to judge at sea so if there is a decent depth contour, it’s much easier to use that as a boundary. In this case, the 20m contour goes in the right direction at about the right angle. A parallel course of about 300° will take me in the right direction and if the depth shallows below 20m (plus tide), I’ll know I am being pushed too far north. Fortunately, I only have to bear away to get to deeper water.\nWhen I am due east of Bolt Head, the 20m contour veers off west and the water then shallows quite uniformly towards the bar.\n\nTransits aren’t always easy to pick out, which is where pilot books can provide helpful advice and photos\n\nThinking Ahead\nDue east of Bolt Head is also about the time I’ll be able to see the whole transit for the first time because the cliffs will have obscured my view of it until then. Once I’ve positively identified it I can relax a bit but still need to think ahead.\nAt this point with about 3/4 mile to run (about 10 minutes) to the bar, I’ll want to think about getting my sails down. As I’ll be clear of the transit and in more sheltered water at this point, it’s about as good a place as any to get them down.\nIt then looks like a pretty clear run towards the bar. The depth reduces gradually from 20m down towards 5m and it’s only at the 5m contour that I need to be careful. I can angle my way in, monitoring the depth and ideally try and judge it so I arrive on transit just before the bar. What is important is the transit isn’t my only reference point.\n\nThe National Coastwatch Institute lookout at Prawle Point, to the west of Salcombe, is always happy to give you a radio check on VHF ch 65. Photo: Paul Gibbins Photography\n\nA gradually shallowing depth is to be expected and there is lots of water up until the transit.\nThat changes once I arrive at the 5m contour. At that point I really want to be close to the transit, not because there isn’t room to the east, there is, but it will be hard to work out how far away from it I am. Being close to the transit also leads me towards my next mark.\n\nSalcombe Bar in a south easterly can be all but impassable. Note the shallow areas shown by breaking water\n\nOver the bar\nThe transit takes me over the bar at what seems to be one of the deepest parts (1.4m). If I stay on the transit I then shouldn’t miss seeing a red port-hand buoy 50m to the left of me at the point where the cliffs seem the closest.\nA problem I might have is other boats either entering with me or leaving. All may stop me using the transit and, if so, I will need to keep to starboard. If I do get pushed off the transit to the right (east) between the bar and the red buoy, I need to be careful that I don’t get caught up in the rest of the bar (named ‘The Bar’ on the chartlet) on the eastern side. But how to identify if that’s happening? The Bar is just 40m from the transit which isn’t much (two boats passing each other can use up 20m).\nAs the Bar’s depth is given as 1.5m and the 2m contour is defined north/south, I have a straight-forward depth boundary. I could just calculate the depth I would see if I crossed it and head to port (west) or slow down as necessary.\n\nYour sketch chart will help you know how much wiggle room you have to deviate. A quick clearing bearing or depth contour can set limits to show you when you’re safe\n\nHowever, I can make things a little simpler and more assured. As I will want to know when I am crossing over the main bar anyway, I am going to be watching the depth like a hawk. As the two bar depths are so similar (within 10cm), and, assuming they haven’t changed, all I need to do is note the shallowest depth I see when I cross the main bar and note that height.\nWhat’s better is I’m using the actual height of tide at the time rather than the predicted height. I then use that as my ‘don’t-go-any-shallower-than’ depth for the right-hand-side as I head north. All of that boils down to: between the (outer) bar and the first red buoy, I don’t want to let the depth get any lower than the shallowest depth I saw when I crossed the bar – deeper water will always be towards the transit.\n\nSome plotter apps, like TimeZero’s TZiBoat, let you spin your view and use 3D elevations to make visualising the pilotage much easier\n\nMaking the Turn\nLooking roughly 055° from the first (most southerly) red buoy, there should be a line of green buoys over to the right marking the right-hand side of the channel as it turns north-east. The chart also gives a leading light bearing of 042.5° which is actually on the wrong side of the channel for entering the harbour.\nThe bearing is fine, just not the ground track. As I’ll need to stay right to keep to the correct side of the channel anyway, it’ll pay to try and leave the transit as soon as I can and cross to hug the green buoys. I’ll want to avoid staying on the transit too long and for a line of boats to feel it’s ok to cut the corner and go between me and the greens and stop me crossing over.\nThe other important thing to note is the channel isn’t very wide and there are a few nasty-looking drying rocks close to the channel edges. It’s worth making sure they are all marked on my sketch map so I have a good idea of the detail.\n\nA quiet day afloat is easy, but even in calm conditions, lots of boat traffic can make staying on course and spotting buoys tricky\n\nInto the (sea) ‘weeds’\nFrom the chart, it looks like I must keep the very first red to port because it marks a big rock (+0.8m). Once the first starboard mark is due east (think in compass points which don’t change, as terms such as ‘off the beam’, ‘off the quarter’ change with boat angle), there is quite a bit of clear water to the north and west of the first red but it doesn’t have a clear boundary.\nI could use my noted shallowest bar depth here too if necessary. The closest rock I could hit in that area has the lower main red-and-white transit post sticking out of it which I’ll have already seen. There is also a rock between the first and second green buoys the other side of the 2m contour; and there is a little room between the second and third green buoy. Helpfully, the rock between them is marked by a fixed green and white post (so is absolutely on station).\nThe final two marks in the channel are a red and white post and red buoy that I must not go north of on the other side of the channel, and that’s it. I’m then safely into the main channel.\n\nTied up safely alongside the visitor pontoon with the wind blowing the boat off for a quiet night. Salcombe is round the corner to the right of the shot\n\nFinding a mooring\nThe Harbour Guide and pilot books state that Salcombe can be very busy so it’s good to have an idea where you want to moor and also a backup location. I hope to try and moor on the visitor’s pontoon in ‘The Bag’, around the corner from the main town quay as it’s more sheltered.\nI should however, keep a lookout to see what mooring buoys are available as I pass them up the main channel and be prepared to come back and raft if necessary. The last thing to think about is to double check what time the tide is going to turn and have a look for good areas to turn around in as I am likely to be arriving around full flood (albeit neaps).\nIn a perfect world, I’d want to favour port-side-to on the western side of the visitors pontoon (in The Bag) so I am being blown off.\n\nMooring in ‘The Bag’ gives all-important shelter from the SW\n\nA final note\nPlease don’t be put off if, when reading the entry strategy section of this article, it seems like too much hard work. It’s much harder to read and to follow than to work out for yourself. If nothing else, it will hopefully give you an idea of the level of detail I go into when entering an unfamiliar port or when doing a bit of tricky pilotage.\nDo give it a go, it works. Also don’t forget, although your entry strategy and the sketch map can be used alone, you should also have a chart plotter, whether it’s on your phone, a tablet or a dedicated unit. What this process does is make you more aware of your surroundings and allows you to retain much more information. Consequently it gives you better tools to make and execute a really detailed plan.\nAs you’re heading in, your plotter then only needs to confirm your position for you. Importantly this is within an area you are really familiar with and at a time when you know what you are trying to do. With both ‘systems’ working in conjunction with each other, it really is an incredibly powerful combination, that makes for much easier and much less stressful pilotage.\nYou’ll know when you are getting it right when you arrive in a ‘tricky’ port and wonder what all of the fuss was about.\nEnjoyed reading this?\nA subscription to Yachting Monthly magazine costs around 40% less than the cover price, so you can save money compared to buying single issues.\nPrint and digital editions are available through Magazines Direct – where you can also find the latest deals.\nYM is packed with information to help you get the most from your time on the water.\nTake your seamanship to the next level with tips, advice and skills from our experts\nImpartial in-depth reviews of the latest yachts and equipment\nCruising guides to help you reach those dream destinations\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nThe post Your complete guide to yacht pilotage (done properly) appeared first on Yachting Monthly.",

The Opal series is basedon handicap starting, with slower yachts setting off first.</p>\n<p>So, on 23 September 2023 I was skippering my 18ft yacht, Doux Bisou, a Beneteau 18 SE daysailer, with Henry as crew, in one of the series races. I was then aged 70 and Henry had just turned 13. I have experience of dinghy sailing over many years but class myself as moderately competent. Henry has six or seven years’ dinghy experience and is a competent single-handed sailor of smaller dinghies.</p>\n<p>My experience in the boat was limited, as I had taken delivery of it towards the end of the previous summer. I am qualified to Coastal Skipper level (motor) and also enjoy time on the water in a 27ft motor boat.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100311\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100311\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100311\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.14_First_18_SE_12-630x354.png\" alt=\"David’s dinghy sailing experience was limited but his grandson Henry had seven years’ experience and is a competent single-handed sailor.\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.14_First_18_SE_12-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.14_First_18_SE_12-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.14_First_18_SE_12-768x432.png 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.14_First_18_SE_12-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.14_First_18_SE_12.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100311\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">David’s dinghy sailing experience was limited but his grandson Henry had seven years’ experience and is a competent single-handed sailor.

Both wind and swell were due to build later but conditions should have been comfortable enough during the period of the race. The course was D, G, M, Q, G, D, that is: south out of the estuary, turn west at the Cannis Rock South Cardinal, anticlockwise around St Austell Bay, and back.</p>\n<p>An early minor problem (the soft shackle attaching the jib sheets to the jib came adrift, so I hove to, to remedy the issue), caused me to be well at the back of the fleet shortly after the start. Still, I decided to push on and complete the course. We didn’t regain touch with the other yachts and after the last mark in St Austell Bay, Q, we were heading east to the Cannis Rock South Cardinal and home.</p>\n<p>The wind was gusting to about 20 knots, possibly more, and the swell was about 1.8m, the weather conditions having deteriorated earlier than anticipated. No other boats were in sight.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100310\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100310\" class=\"wp-image-100310 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.10_Alamy_2P911GM-630x354.png\" alt=\"Once out of the river and into St Austell Bay, sailors are exposed to weather and swell from the South West\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.10_Alamy_2P911GM-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.10_Alamy_2P911GM-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.10_Alamy_2P911GM-768x432.png 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.10_Alamy_2P911GM-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.10_Alamy_2P911GM.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100310\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Once out of the river and into St Austell Bay, sailors are exposed to weather and swell from the South West.

We resolved this and the spinnaker was set and trimmed. However, the boat was immediately overpowered by the gusting wind and was knocked flat.</p>\n<p>We managed to regain our footing but no sooner had the boat righted than it was knocked flat again. I lost my footing and fell into the water, while Henry managed to stay in the boat. As I surfaced, the boat was already 10m away from me with the distance only growing. The spinnaker was flapping, making a din and I could see Henry signalling to me, although Henry has told me that I was very quickly out of sight in those sea conditions.</p>\n<p>Henry had very little knowledge of the boat. However, he managed to drop the spinnaker but only to the extent that it was in the water beside the boat. The boat was then relatively stable but was prevented from sailing by the impediment of the spinnaker. Henry had no knowledge of how to get the motor into operation and therefore could not use that either to address the problem of being somewhere near the Cannis Rock and being pushed ever closer by wind and swell.</p>\n<p><em>Article continues below&#8230;</em></p>\n\n\n<div id=\"accordion\" class=\"collection-wrapper list-large \">\n\n\t\t\t\t<article class=\"loop loop-list-large row post-65583 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-cruising-guides tag-cruising publication_name-yachting-monthly loop-odd loop-17 featured-image\" role=\"article\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 entry-media\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/cruising-guides/golant-fowey-65583\" rel=\"bookmark\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"630\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2018/04/Golant-Fowey.jpg\" class=\"attachment-square size-square wp-post-image\" alt=\"River Fowey\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2018/04/Golant-Fowey.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2018/04/Golant-Fowey-300x190.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" data-image-id=\"65589\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/cruising-guides/golant-fowey-65583\" rel=\"bookmark\">Golant, Fowey: a charming anchorage</a></h2>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</header>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\n                            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Ken Endean meanders upriver at Fowey for some proper Cornish hospitality and stunning countryside</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</article>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<article class=\"loop loop-list-large row post-96986 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-news tag-news-2 tag-top-story publication_name-yachting-monthly loop-odd loop-17 featured-image\" role=\"article\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 entry-media\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/news/celebrating-200-years-of-the-rnli-96986\" rel=\"bookmark\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1126\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/03/03_YAM300.news1_.RNLI_historic_Hauxley_Northumberland.jpg\" class=\"attachment-square size-square wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/03/03_YAM300.news1_.RNLI_historic_Hauxley_Northumberland.jpg 2000w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/03/03_YAM300.news1_.RNLI_historic_Hauxley_Northumberland-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/03/03_YAM300.news1_.RNLI_historic_Hauxley_Northumberland-630x355.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/03/03_YAM300.news1_.RNLI_historic_Hauxley_Northumberland-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/03/03_YAM300.news1_.RNLI_historic_Hauxley_Northumberland-1536x865.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" data-image-id=\"96990\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/news/celebrating-200-years-of-the-rnli-96986\" rel=\"bookmark\">Celebrating 200 years of the RNLI</a></h2>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</header>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\n                            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The RNLI was founded in 1824 by Isle of Man resident Sir William Hillary, has saved a tremendous 146,277 lives&hellip;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</article>\n\n\t\t\t\n</div><!-- /#accordion -->\n\n<h2>Armed with knowledge</h2>\n<p>Fortunately, Henry, being interested in all things related to sailing, had just two weeks earlier picked up his mum’s VHF Radio course book and absorbed it in his inimitable fashion.

Consequently, while I was floating I faced west in the hope that I might see it on its return to Fowey. I was overjoyed when I did in fact see the RIB, but what I didn’t at that point appreciate was that it came onto station as a result of Henry’s Mayday call.</p>\n<p>So I wondered why it did not appear to be making an attempt to get close enough to haul me out. That was clarified when I was told the <a href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/news/celebrating-200-years-of-the-rnli-96986\">RNLI</a> was approaching and that the RIB was marking my position. I looked around to see the Fowey Trent class lifeboat, with the Coastguard helicopter above it.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Fowey’s D class lifeboat started helping Henry. Jimmy Hoddinott (of the Fowey D class lifeboat) transferred to Doux Bisou and, after removing the tangled spinnaker sheets, stowed the spinnaker in its chute. They then proceeded to sail back into Fowey.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100309\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100309\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100309\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.09_GIOK7557-630x354.png\" alt=\"David and Henry set sail out of the Fowey Estuary on Doux Bisou, David’s Beneteau 18 SE \" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.09_GIOK7557-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.09_GIOK7557-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.09_GIOK7557-768x432.png 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.09_GIOK7557-1536x863.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.09_GIOK7557.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100309\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">David and Henry set sail out of the Fowey Estuary on Doux Bisou, David’s Beneteau 18 SE. Photo: Jenny Matthews/Alamy Stock Photo</p></div>\n<p>The RNLI fished me out and after making sure I had no injuries, were able to stand the helicopter down. The RNLI took me back to their station and gave me very welcome hot, sweet tea.</p>\n<p>I was able to observe Henry and Jimmy Hoddinott sailing Doux Bisou in and fairly nonchalantly mooring up. Henry and I were able to check we were both okay before the ambulance arrived to have me checked over at hospital as I had spent 20 to 25 minutes in the water, and risk of secondary drowning was an issue. The care and attention I received, from the Coastguard, the RNLI, the NHS and the boating community was exceptional and very humbling.</p>\n<p>I was not the only casualty of the day’s testing conditions: a crew member of one of the larger yachts suffered a dislocated shoulder. Henry and I did not sail for the rest of the series, mostly because wind and sea conditions were adverse through to the end of October on those days when Henry was available.</p>\n<p>However, we are planning on sailing together again this year, particularly on the Fowey to Flushing race (and back) in August, providing the conditions are suitable. Henry will otherwise continue with his single-handed dinghy racing.</p>\n<h2>Lessons learned from a lifeboat rescue</h2>\n<h3>Safety Equipment</h3>\n<p>I was wearing a self-inflating life jacket while Henry was wearing a buoyancy aid. I had not done up the crotch strap of the life jacket. The boat was equipped with a handheld VHF radio, emergency flare, one lifeline and a safety knife, none of which was on my person or attached to Henry or myself.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100306\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100306\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100306\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.04_13_year_old_who_raised_mayday_alarm_to_save_his_grandad_commended_by_fowey_rnli3-630x354.png\" alt=\"David Richards is a semi-retired quantity surveyor who started dinghy sailing in a Fireball while at school in Zimbabwe. \" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.04_13_year_old_who_raised_mayday_alarm_to_save_his_grandad_commended_by_fowey_rnli3-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.04_13_year_old_who_raised_mayday_alarm_to_save_his_grandad_commended_by_fowey_rnli3-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.04_13_year_old_who_raised_mayday_alarm_to_save_his_grandad_commended_by_fowey_rnli3-768x432.png 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.04_13_year_old_who_raised_mayday_alarm_to_save_his_grandad_commended_by_fowey_rnli3-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.skills_lc_MOB.04_13_year_old_who_raised_mayday_alarm_to_save_his_grandad_commended_by_fowey_rnli3.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100306\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">David Richards is a semi-retired quantity surveyor who started dinghy sailing in a Fireball while at school in Zimbabwe.

Nonetheless, due to the size of the boat and its ‘insubmersibility’ volume, it is not equipped with a life raft. It is easy to board the boat from the water at the transom, which is open.</p>\n<h3>Racing safety</h3>\n<p>Observing standard safety procedures is not enough and assuming that reasonable competency will suffice is inadequate. Perilous scenarios should be mapped<br />\nout and practised before getting into the hurly burly of racing.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "When David Richards and his grandson Henry went out racing from Fowey, they didn’t expect their sail to end with a lifeboat rescue.\nHenry, David and the \ncrew of the Fowey’s \nTrent class lifeboat. Photo: Jenny Matthews/Alamy Stock Photo\nHenry, my grandson, and I decided to sail together for the Fowey Sailing Opal series, the last yacht race series of the season, as his dinghy season was complete and he was at a loose end (sailing-wise) until his winter sailing started with the RS Tera South West Squad. The Opal series is basedon handicap starting, with slower yachts setting off first.\nSo, on 23 September 2023 I was skippering my 18ft yacht, Doux Bisou, a Beneteau 18 SE daysailer, with Henry as crew, in one of the series races. I was then aged 70 and Henry had just turned 13. I have experience of dinghy sailing over many years but class myself as moderately competent. Henry has six or seven years’ dinghy experience and is a competent single-handed sailor of smaller dinghies.\nMy experience in the boat was limited, as I had taken delivery of it towards the end of the previous summer. I am qualified to Coastal Skipper level (motor) and also enjoy time on the water in a 27ft motor boat.\n\nDavid’s dinghy sailing experience was limited but his grandson Henry had seven years’ experience and is a competent single-handed sailor. Photo: Beneteau\n\nThe forecast was for southerly wind, initially gusting to around 16 knots, and a 0.8m (2-3ft) swell. Both wind and swell were due to build later but conditions should have been comfortable enough during the period of the race. The course was D, G, M, Q, G, D, that is: south out of the estuary, turn west at the Cannis Rock South Cardinal, anticlockwise around St Austell Bay, and back.\nAn early minor problem (the soft shackle attaching the jib sheets to the jib came adrift, so I hove to, to remedy the issue), caused me to be well at the back of the fleet shortly after the start. Still, I decided to push on and complete the course. We didn’t regain touch with the other yachts and after the last mark in St Austell Bay, Q, we were heading east to the Cannis Rock South Cardinal and home.\nThe wind was gusting to about 20 knots, possibly more, and the swell was about 1.8m, the weather conditions having deteriorated earlier than anticipated. No other boats were in sight.\n\nOnce out of the river and into St Austell Bay, sailors are exposed to weather and swell from the South West. Photo: TMW Photography/Alamy\n\nBeing on a beam reach and given that we were still racing, I decided to hoist the spinnaker and immediately faced problems with the leeward spinnaker sheet having wrapped on the end of the boom. We resolved this and the spinnaker was set and trimmed. However, the boat was immediately overpowered by the gusting wind and was knocked flat.\nWe managed to regain our footing but no sooner had the boat righted than it was knocked flat again. I lost my footing and fell into the water, while Henry managed to stay in the boat. As I surfaced, the boat was already 10m away from me with the distance only growing. The spinnaker was flapping, making a din and I could see Henry signalling to me, although Henry has told me that I was very quickly out of sight in those sea conditions.\nHenry had very little knowledge of the boat. However, he managed to drop the spinnaker but only to the extent that it was in the water beside the boat. The boat was then relatively stable but was prevented from sailing by the impediment of the spinnaker. Henry had no knowledge of how to get the motor into operation and therefore could not use that either to address the problem of being somewhere near the Cannis Rock and being pushed ever closer by wind and swell.\nArticle continues below…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nGolant, Fowey: a charming anchorage\nKen Endean meanders upriver at Fowey for some proper Cornish hospitality and stunning countryside\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nCelebrating 200 years of the RNLI\nThe RNLI was founded in 1824 by Isle of Man resident Sir William Hillary, has saved a tremendous 146,277 lives…\n\n\nArmed with knowledge\nFortunately, Henry, being interested in all things related to sailing, had just two weeks earlier picked up his mum’s VHF Radio course book and absorbed it in his inimitable fashion. Henry sent out a textbook Mayday call using the hand-held VHF radio in the boat, changing from the race office channel to channel 16, alerting the Coastguard to me going overboard, the boat not being under proper control and his location being close to the Cannis Rock.\nUnfortunately, the race office was not monitoring Ch16 and were among the last to know of the Mayday call, to which a number of Fowey boats responded.\n\nHenry has been sailing since he was seven and is a keen RS Tera racer. Photo: Jenny Matthews/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nEarlier in the afternoon I had seen the big Seafari RIB set out towards Mevagissey but I hadn’t seen it return. Consequently, while I was floating I faced west in the hope that I might see it on its return to Fowey. I was overjoyed when I did in fact see the RIB, but what I didn’t at that point appreciate was that it came onto station as a result of Henry’s Mayday call.\nSo I wondered why it did not appear to be making an attempt to get close enough to haul me out. That was clarified when I was told the RNLI was approaching and that the RIB was marking my position. I looked around to see the Fowey Trent class lifeboat, with the Coastguard helicopter above it.\nAt the same time, Fowey’s D class lifeboat started helping Henry. Jimmy Hoddinott (of the Fowey D class lifeboat) transferred to Doux Bisou and, after removing the tangled spinnaker sheets, stowed the spinnaker in its chute. They then proceeded to sail back into Fowey.\n\nDavid and Henry set sail out of the Fowey Estuary on Doux Bisou, David’s Beneteau 18 SE. Photo: Jenny Matthews/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nThe RNLI fished me out and after making sure I had no injuries, were able to stand the helicopter down. The RNLI took me back to their station and gave me very welcome hot, sweet tea.\nI was able to observe Henry and Jimmy Hoddinott sailing Doux Bisou in and fairly nonchalantly mooring up. Henry and I were able to check we were both okay before the ambulance arrived to have me checked over at hospital as I had spent 20 to 25 minutes in the water, and risk of secondary drowning was an issue. The care and attention I received, from the Coastguard, the RNLI, the NHS and the boating community was exceptional and very humbling.\nI was not the only casualty of the day’s testing conditions: a crew member of one of the larger yachts suffered a dislocated shoulder. Henry and I did not sail for the rest of the series, mostly because wind and sea conditions were adverse through to the end of October on those days when Henry was available.\nHowever, we are planning on sailing together again this year, particularly on the Fowey to Flushing race (and back) in August, providing the conditions are suitable. Henry will otherwise continue with his single-handed dinghy racing.\nLessons learned from a lifeboat rescue\nSafety Equipment\nI was wearing a self-inflating life jacket while Henry was wearing a buoyancy aid. I had not done up the crotch strap of the life jacket. The boat was equipped with a handheld VHF radio, emergency flare, one lifeline and a safety knife, none of which was on my person or attached to Henry or myself.\n\nDavid Richards is a semi-retired quantity surveyor who started dinghy sailing in a Fireball while at school in Zimbabwe. Photo: TMW Photography/Alamy\n\nThe boat also has a 1m³ built-in ‘insubmersibility’ volume so that it is notionally unsinkable. However, that, of course, is what was said about Titanic! Nonetheless, due to the size of the boat and its ‘insubmersibility’ volume, it is not equipped with a life raft. It is easy to board the boat from the water at the transom, which is open.\nRacing safety\nObserving standard safety procedures is not enough and assuming that reasonable competency will suffice is inadequate. Perilous scenarios should be mapped\nSpinnaker use\nThe spinnaker should be used more judiciously. If I had not raised the spinnaker on a beam reach in high-ish wind, I would not have gone overboard. The racing advantage of any sail change or manoeuvre should be weighed against risks of collision or crew loss.\nPersonal floatation\nWhen sailing keelboats outside of immediate safety cover, both helm and crew should have self-inflating life jackets, equipped with PLBs, and the crotch strap should be fastened (in the final heave onto the RNLI lifeboat, my lifejacket was nearly pulled off).\n\nFowey RNLI commended Henry’s brave actions. Photo: Jenny Matthews/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nTethers and knives\nIf I had been connected to the boat through a life line I would at least have stayed with the boat but, in that case, we should also both have been carrying safety knives in case problems arose from being tied to the boat and dragged through the water, chest first.\nPersonal communication devices\nWhile a PLB would have allowed me to make a distress signal, I should have been wearing the VHF radio and had another in the boat.\nCrew briefing\nHenry did an amazing job remaining calm and calling for help, largely due to experience built up over previous years and his desire to learn more.

I raised a small sum of money from friends and family for medical and school supplies, and returned with a used mainsail that was donated by Crusader Sails.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100294\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100294\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100294\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.14_IMG_7668-630x355.png\" alt=\"Local fishermen inspect the donated sail\" width=\"630\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.14_IMG_7668-630x355.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.14_IMG_7668-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.14_IMG_7668-768x432.png 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.14_IMG_7668-1536x865.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.14_IMG_7668.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100294\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Local fishermen inspect the donated sail.

Led by a former slave and the first black general of the French Army, Toussaint L’Ouverture, the war of independence lasted 13 years until they defeated Napoleon’s forces and declared sovereignty on 1 January 1804. Haïti was the first independent nation of the Caribbean and Latin America, the first country to abolish slavery and the only state in history established by a successful slave revolt.</p>\n<p>The following century of independence was beset with political instability and ostracisation from the international community. They had to repay crippling debt to France, levied in exchange for their sovereignty.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100289\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100289\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100289\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.07_DJI_0598-630x354.png\" alt=\"Sailing Lordship under spinnaker en route to Haiti. \" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.07_DJI_0598-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.07_DJI_0598-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.07_DJI_0598-768x432.png 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.07_DJI_0598-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.07_DJI_0598.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100289\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sailing Lordship under spinnaker en route to Haiti.

I cruised along the north coast of the Dominican Republic stopping at the island of Tororu in the Cayos Hermanos.</p>\n<p>In Tororu either I decided to sacrifice my Iridium on the altar of Neptune, or I was being clumsy, let’s say the former. It tumbled overboard and I immediately jumped in after it, fully clothed, expelling expletives mid air. When I hit the surface, I immediately inhaled some saltwater.</p>\n<p>Blinded by my own stupidity, the device eluded me as I grasped for it in vain. By the time I’d returned to the boat to dig out my mask, it was comfortably ensconced amongst the weeds and no search pattern I initiated revealed its location. There was a definite crisis of confidence at this point. After a day of contemplation, I concluded that the Iridium was an overpriced comfort blanket.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100293\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100293\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100293\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.13_IMG_7619-630x354.png\" alt=\"Meeting new friends. \" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.13_IMG_7619-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.13_IMG_7619-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.13_IMG_7619-768x432.png 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.13_IMG_7619-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.13_IMG_7619.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100293\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Meeting new friends.

In any case they wouldn’t be much help on the ground, should anything go wrong.</p>\n<p>I woke up at 0400 and set off to cover the 55 miles from Tororu to Basse Terre on Île de la Tortue, an infamous hideout of pirates throughout history. Although the Iridium had bitten the brine, I had a downloaded wind forecast that was only 36 hours old. It held true, and I ghosted along with my asymmetrical spinnaker, making 3 knots from the 8 knots of wind I was offered. Clearly Neptune was not impressed by my electronic sacrifice.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of the afternoon I passed into the Canal de la Tortue. At this point even the wind feared to go any further, so Lordship was under iron sails. I kept to the middle of the channel, but as I passed along the coast of Île de la Tortue to starboard I started seeing the fine lines of sailing yachts and masts. I edged closer to see the wooden sailboats produced on the island – an impressive sight.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100287\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100287\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100287\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.04_DJI_0406-630x354.png\" alt=\"Port Basse-Terre, Île de la Tortue.\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.04_DJI_0406-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.04_DJI_0406-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.04_DJI_0406-768x432.png 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.04_DJI_0406-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.04_DJI_0406.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100287\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Port Basse-Terre, Île de la Tortue.

No one came out to greet me and I didn’t have the energy to launch my auxiliary, so I headed for an early night, clutching the largest frying pan I could muster to my chest for comfort.</p>\n<p>After a very peaceful night I headed into shore on my dinghy. A large crowd of children gathered at the shore and excitedly hailed me. When I tied up to an old rowing boat and waded over to them they were all smiling and laughing.</p>\n<p>When I pulled out the football from my bag, the crowd went wild. They proceeded to drag me around the village and show me the ruins of an old fort, the park, and we eventually ended up on the football field for some five-a-side football.</p>\n<p>The following day I met a man called Necksonne. He had lived in Miami for over a decade and returned to the island to try and build up a hotel and bar. He spoke good English and French and was extremely helpful. On his advice I moved inside the reef where there was a lot less swell. Necksonne told me that on the island: ‘We don’t have no government, no gangs, and no problems, we want to keep it that way.’</p>\n<p>On Sunday I walked up the hillside to the local settlement for the church service. It was an invigorating 45-minute hike. In the settlement I was met with curious and friendly greetings. After the service I met the Haïtian pastor and missionary nuns from Kenya and passed on some of my donations.</p>\n<h2>Midway anchorage</h2>\n<p>I spent three relaxing days in Basse Terre before departing with the intention of anchoring on the western tip of Île de la Tortue. The wind was funneling through the Canal from the west, it would either be motoring or beating. In the end, as is often the way, I opted for a bit of both, with the benefit of neither.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100292\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100292\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100292\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.12_Weaving_Haiti-630x354.png\" alt=\"Fisherman weaving traps. \" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.12_Weaving_Haiti-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.12_Weaving_Haiti-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.12_Weaving_Haiti-768x432.png 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.12_Weaving_Haiti-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.12_Weaving_Haiti.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100292\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fisherman weaving traps.

With the sun dropping rapidly towards the horizon like stone, I decided to anchor between two settlements on the south coast of the island. Not a proper anchorage, but an acceptable depth with sand and rock bottom that held my anchor.</p>\n<p>I had my first negative encounter that evening with a rowing boat containing three men. Two men in their prime and one older gentleman. The older man, clearly in charge, started shaking a spear gun over his head and shouting at me. An auspicious beginning to any interaction. He was shouting ‘Give me one! Give me a new one!’ I told him that unfortunately I didn’t have one.</p>\n<p>Unperturbed, he pointed to the elastic, ‘Give me one rubber,’ this request I also politely declined. I was then treated to a few choice curse words in Creole. At this point I was feeling slightly tense and was regretting my choice of secluded anchorage. Thankfully the men rowed away.</p>\n<p>That night I did not sleep easy, spending the first half of the night in the cockpit until around 0100, at which time I woke from a nightmare about being boarded. Realising I was letting fear and prejudice rule me, and that it was unlikely anyone would come to the boat, I retired down below to sleep peacefully.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100299\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100299\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100299\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.20_Sail_boat_haiti-630x354.png\" alt=\"Haïtian ferry to the mainland. \" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.20_Sail_boat_haiti-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.20_Sail_boat_haiti-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.20_Sail_boat_haiti-768x432.png 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.20_Sail_boat_haiti-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.20_Sail_boat_haiti.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100299\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Haïtian ferry to the mainland.

I felt slightly on edge as I spoke to them, crowded on my swim platform. Eventually I closed proceedings with ‘Au revoir, mes amis’ and they left amicably. I rowed over to shore and was again met by excited children who took me by the hand, pulling me through the village. I was introduced to the Pasteur, and once I had spoken with him, my mind was at ease that Carenage was a safe place for me.</p>\n<h2>Beauty and deprivation</h2>\n<p>Mole Saint Nicholas is a beauty spot that was often visited by people from Haïti, before Port au Prince became riven with gang violence and travel by roads became too dangerous for most. On the south-west corner of the bay there was a beautiful beach, with a few hotels and some bars and restaurants, but it was completely empty while I was there.</p>\n<p>Mole Saint Nicholas was a large town. I walked into it to deliver the medicines to the mayor. The town had wide streets that seemed in good condition, but there were not many vehicles or people around. The Pasteur told me there were very few jobs, and most were getting by on food they could grow or fish.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100290\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100290\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100290\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.08_DSC00165-630x354.png\" alt=\"Andy bought his Westerly Sealord in 2018 in the UK. \" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.08_DSC00165-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.08_DSC00165-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.08_DSC00165-768x432.png 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.08_DSC00165-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.feat_ad_haiti_8pg.08_DSC00165.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100290\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Andy bought his Westerly Sealord in 2018 in the UK.

In contrast, Île de la Tortue was lush and verdant with mango trees growing all over the place. The readily available food supply was much more scarce in Mole Saint Nicholas, even the bay seemed to have less sea life. I was acutely aware of the hunger and desperation in this place.</p>\n<p>There were constant cries of mon blanc (white man) and mwa gangou (I am hungry) from the children, and after the third day of refusing to give out food, I felt animosity from some villagers.</p>\n<p>On the fourth morning I lifted the anchor, waved goodbye to the children and the Pasteur and headed west for Cuba. Visiting Haïti was one of the most unique and rewarding experiences of my life. I hope that sailors start shrugging off society’s prejudices and add Haïti to their itinerary.</p>\n<h2>Cruising Resources</h2>\n<h3>Safe anchorage</h3>\n<p>Basse-Terre on Île de la Tortue is a safe anchorage.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Sailing to Haiti, Andy Brown brings medical and school supplies to the town of Mole Saint Nicholas\nPhoto: Andrew Brown\nLordship, my Westerly Sealord, had been stranded in the Dominican Republic for two months. I had been sailing from Martinique towards Cuba with two friends. We were having trouble with our batteries, so we stopped along the south coast of Hispaniola. In the evening I went up the mast to retrieve a halyard when I spotted damage to the shrouds.\nA few strands of the cable were broken at the tang. The Dominican Republic didn’t have facilities to swage new shrouds, so I ended up staying for much longer than I wanted. My crew left disappointed and I spent the time waiting for replacements, planning my next steps.\n\nAndy feeling peaceful aboard Lordship. Photo: Andrew Brown\n\nI started looking at sailing to Haïti, and contemplating why I sail. For me, a large part of that decision is the desire to take the road less travelled. Cuba was a start, but sailing to Haïti is possibly the paragon of that sentiment.\nI returned to the UK and Europe to regroup, and decided that Lordship would be bound for Haïti. I raised a small sum of money from friends and family for medical and school supplies, and returned with a used mainsail that was donated by Crusader Sails.\n\nLocal fishermen inspect the donated sail. Photo: Andrew Brown\n\nA volatile history\nHaïti was the first slave colony to successfully revolt. Led by a former slave and the first black general of the French Army, Toussaint L’Ouverture, the war of independence lasted 13 years until they defeated Napoleon’s forces and declared sovereignty on 1 January 1804. Haïti was the first independent nation of the Caribbean and Latin America, the first country to abolish slavery and the only state in history established by a successful slave revolt.\nThe following century of independence was beset with political instability and ostracisation from the international community. They had to repay crippling debt to France, levied in exchange for their sovereignty.\n\nSailing Lordship under spinnaker en route to Haiti. Photo: Andrew Brown\n\nThe unending instability in Haïti has led some to wonder if being the first nation to shake off the shackles of slavery did not lead to a concerted effort by the western world to ‘punish’ a nation of former slaves that dared to want freedom. A critical analysis of international aid could lead one to question whether much has changed in modern times.\nArticle continues below…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nCruising Guadeloupe: one couple explore a paradise teeming with natural wonders\nThe French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe is the most southerly of the Leeward Islands. Shaped like a butterfly, it is…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSailing to warmer climates for winter: ‘The nerves are still there, sometimes utterly stomach churning’\nYou don’t really notice it too much at first. At each stopover on our summer Mediterranean wanderings we meet up…\n\n\nSailing to Haiti – Iridium bites the brine\nEarly one morning, with very little wind and dire warnings about my life expectancy from other cruisers echoing in my ears, I departed Ocean World Marina in Puerto Plata. I cruised along the north coast of the Dominican Republic stopping at the island of Tororu in the Cayos Hermanos.\nIn Tororu either I decided to sacrifice my Iridium on the altar of Neptune, or I was being clumsy, let’s say the former. It tumbled overboard and I immediately jumped in after it, fully clothed, expelling expletives mid air. When I hit the surface, I immediately inhaled some saltwater.\nBlinded by my own stupidity, the device eluded me as I grasped for it in vain. By the time I’d returned to the boat to dig out my mask, it was comfortably ensconced amongst the weeds and no search pattern I initiated revealed its location. There was a definite crisis of confidence at this point. After a day of contemplation, I concluded that the Iridium was an overpriced comfort blanket.\n\nMeeting new friends. Photo: Andrew Brown\n\nI still had my mobile phone, for 35p I could message my location to someone each day, and in emergencies I could pay a totally reasonable £32.99 per megabyte, and send a live location. In any case they wouldn’t be much help on the ground, should anything go wrong.\nI woke up at 0400 and set off to cover the 55 miles from Tororu to Basse Terre on Île de la Tortue, an infamous hideout of pirates throughout history. Although the Iridium had bitten the brine, I had a downloaded wind forecast that was only 36 hours old. It held true, and I ghosted along with my asymmetrical spinnaker, making 3 knots from the 8 knots of wind I was offered. Clearly Neptune was not impressed by my electronic sacrifice.\nTowards the end of the afternoon I passed into the Canal de la Tortue. At this point even the wind feared to go any further, so Lordship was under iron sails. I kept to the middle of the channel, but as I passed along the coast of Île de la Tortue to starboard I started seeing the fine lines of sailing yachts and masts. I edged closer to see the wooden sailboats produced on the island – an impressive sight.\n\nPort Basse-Terre, Île de la Tortue. Photo: Andrew Brown\n\nBefore the sun set I was comfortably anchored outside the reef at Basse-Terre. I watched the sailing boats plying their trade. No one came out to greet me and I didn’t have the energy to launch my auxiliary, so I headed for an early night, clutching the largest frying pan I could muster to my chest for comfort.\nAfter a very peaceful night I headed into shore on my dinghy. A large crowd of children gathered at the shore and excitedly hailed me. When I tied up to an old rowing boat and waded over to them they were all smiling and laughing.\nWhen I pulled out the football from my bag, the crowd went wild. They proceeded to drag me around the village and show me the ruins of an old fort, the park, and we eventually ended up on the football field for some five-a-side football.\nThe following day I met a man called Necksonne. He had lived in Miami for over a decade and returned to the island to try and build up a hotel and bar. He spoke good English and French and was extremely helpful. On his advice I moved inside the reef where there was a lot less swell. Necksonne told me that on the island: ‘We don’t have no government, no gangs, and no problems, we want to keep it that way.’\nOn Sunday I walked up the hillside to the local settlement for the church service. It was an invigorating 45-minute hike. In the settlement I was met with curious and friendly greetings. After the service I met the Haïtian pastor and missionary nuns from Kenya and passed on some of my donations.\nMidway anchorage\nI spent three relaxing days in Basse Terre before departing with the intention of anchoring on the western tip of Île de la Tortue. The wind was funneling through the Canal from the west, it would either be motoring or beating. In the end, as is often the way, I opted for a bit of both, with the benefit of neither.\n\nFisherman weaving traps. Photo: Andrew Brown\n\nAs the day was drawing to a close I found myself still two hours away from my intended destination. With the sun dropping rapidly towards the horizon like stone, I decided to anchor between two settlements on the south coast of the island. Not a proper anchorage, but an acceptable depth with sand and rock bottom that held my anchor.\nI had my first negative encounter that evening with a rowing boat containing three men. Two men in their prime and one older gentleman. The older man, clearly in charge, started shaking a spear gun over his head and shouting at me. An auspicious beginning to any interaction. He was shouting ‘Give me one! Give me a new one!’ I told him that unfortunately I didn’t have one.\nUnperturbed, he pointed to the elastic, ‘Give me one rubber,’ this request I also politely declined. I was then treated to a few choice curse words in Creole. At this point I was feeling slightly tense and was regretting my choice of secluded anchorage. Thankfully the men rowed away.\nThat night I did not sleep easy, spending the first half of the night in the cockpit until around 0100, at which time I woke from a nightmare about being boarded. Realising I was letting fear and prejudice rule me, and that it was unlikely anyone would come to the boat, I retired down below to sleep peacefully.\n\nHaïtian ferry to the mainland. Photo: Andrew Brown\n\nIt might be worth mentioning here that other than the challenges from environmental disasters and political instability, one of the greatest challenges Haïti faces as a nation is prejudice. I experienced it from sailors and non-sailors, I even exhibited it myself at times.\nEvery Dominican I met, upon hearing I was sailing to Haïti, was shocked and told me that I would be either robbed, murdered or worse! The belief that Haïtians are ‘bad’ is common among people who’ve never met Haïtians or visited Haïti, and yet, I can assure you that Haïtians are no more immoral or nefarious than any other social group. They are just people dealing with adversity and scarcity as best they can.\nI personally encountered overwhelming kindness, generosity, and hope from the Haïtians I met.\n\nAerial view of Lordship. Photo: Andrew Brown\n\nDelivering precious cargo\nThe next morning I decided to forgo visiting the beach at Point Ouest. I wanted to deliver the medicines to Mole Saint Nicholas and be ready to depart for the security of communist Cuba in the forthcoming weather window. There was little wind so I motored for six hours into the Baie du Mole, a beautiful wide bay. I dropped the anchor at the settlement of Carenage.\n\nDelivering medical supplies to the Mayor of Mole St Nicholas. Photo: Andrew Brown\n\nIn Carenage four men came to the boat wanting to help me in some way in return for food, water or money. I felt slightly on edge as I spoke to them, crowded on my swim platform. Eventually I closed proceedings with ‘Au revoir, mes amis’ and they left amicably. I rowed over to shore and was again met by excited children who took me by the hand, pulling me through the village. I was introduced to the Pasteur, and once I had spoken with him, my mind was at ease that Carenage was a safe place for me.\nBeauty and deprivation\nMole Saint Nicholas is a beauty spot that was often visited by people from Haïti, before Port au Prince became riven with gang violence and travel by roads became too dangerous for most. On the south-west corner of the bay there was a beautiful beach, with a few hotels and some bars and restaurants, but it was completely empty while I was there.\nMole Saint Nicholas was a large town. I walked into it to deliver the medicines to the mayor. The town had wide streets that seemed in good condition, but there were not many vehicles or people around. The Pasteur told me there were very few jobs, and most were getting by on food they could grow or fish.\n\nAndy bought his Westerly Sealord in 2018 in the UK. Photo: Andrew Brown\n\nHerein lies the problem for mainland Haïti; throughout the 20th century they deforested the land to produce charcoal, but this has left it infertile. In contrast, Île de la Tortue was lush and verdant with mango trees growing all over the place. The readily available food supply was much more scarce in Mole Saint Nicholas, even the bay seemed to have less sea life. I was acutely aware of the hunger and desperation in this place.\nThere were constant cries of mon blanc (white man) and mwa gangou (I am hungry) from the children, and after the third day of refusing to give out food, I felt animosity from some villagers.\nOn the fourth morning I lifted the anchor, waved goodbye to the children and the Pasteur and headed west for Cuba. Visiting Haïti was one of the most unique and rewarding experiences of my life. I hope that sailors start shrugging off society’s prejudices and add Haïti to their itinerary.\nCruising Resources\nSafe anchorage\nBasse-Terre on Île de la Tortue is a safe anchorage. The people are friendly and the troubles on the mainland don’t impact them too much. The US coast guard passes through the channel most days.\n\nView of Port Basse-Terre with its path leading up to the main village. Photo: Andrew Brown\n\nBe prepared for poverty\nThere is a lot more deprivation and desperation on the mainland, so be aware of what you’re getting yourself into and be prepared.\nCustoms should be a breeze\nAt the locations I visited there was no government presence, so customs & immigration wasn’t possible.\n\nNecksonne, local bar and hostel owner on Île de la Tortue, takes delivery of the sail. Photo: Andrew Brown\n\nStock up in advance\nProvision all you could need before arriving in Haïti: food, fuel, and water.\nEasy access to internet\nInternet access is easy and cheap, around $1/gigabyte. I bought a Navcom SIM, there is also Digicel. You can top up data at small stores.\n\nAndy aboard Lordship. Photo: Andrew Brown\n\nDon’t arrive empty handed\nI would recommend taking things to donate. Second-hand clothing will be very much appreciated. Fishing gear, hooks, line and lures are very sought after by the fishermen. For the kids, take footballs and don’t forget a pump!\nUseful resources\nCheck resources like Navionics and Navily for the latest info from other sailors that have visited.\nEnjoyed reading this?\nA subscription to Yachting Monthly magazine costs around 40% less than the cover price, so you can save money compared to buying single issues.\nPrint and digital editions are available through Magazines Direct – where you can also find the latest deals.\nYM is packed with information to help you get the most from your time on the water.\nTake your seamanship to the next level with tips, advice and skills from our experts\nImpartial in-depth reviews of the latest yachts and equipment\nCruising guides to help you reach those dream destinations\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nThe post Sailing to Haiti: ‘Visiting Haïti has been one of the most  unique and rewarding experiences of my life’ appeared first on Yachting Monthly.",

Tankage is good, with 265L of diesel and 460L of water giving good range, especially if you are sailing two-up.\nHull number one is expected to be sailing in the autumn of 2025.\nHallberg-Rassy 370 specifications\nLOA: 12.13m / 39ft 10in\nHULL LENGTH: 11.32m / 37ft 2in\nLWL: 10.59m 34ft 9in\nBEAM: 3.75m / 12ft 4in\nDRAUGHT: 2.00m / 6ft 7in\nSAIL AREA: 79.6m2 / 850 sq ft\nBALLAST: 2,730kg / 6,020 lbs\nDISP: 8,000kg / 17,600 lbs\nPRICE: Sailaway £324,500 ex VAT\nCONTACT: hallberg-rassy.com\nEnjoyed reading this?\nA subscription to Yachting Monthly magazine costs around 40% less than the cover price, so you can save money compared to buying single issues.\nPrint and digital editions are available through Magazines Direct – where you can also find the latest deals.\nYM is packed with information to help you get the most from your time on the water.\nTake your seamanship to the next level with tips, advice and skills from our experts\nImpartial in-depth reviews of the latest yachts and equipment\nCruising guides to help you reach those dream destinations\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nThe post Hallberg-Rassy 370 first look: Easy handling and good performance appeared first on Yachting Monthly.",

They have assumed that I know what I’m doing. It’s not a long-lasting sensation, but in the early stages, it can be a bit discombobulating for all concerned.</p>\n<p>But this certainly couldn’t be said of my best mate, a dear old mucker of nearly 40 years. He’s seen it all, every level of muppetry imaginable, and always has the air of a spooked animal whenever I invite him to try something where I’m in charge. This changes to a bovine acceptance of imminent death once we’re underway, and then sheer, unadulterated, unfettered joy when I give up and turn for home.</p>\n<p>And so as he stepped aboard <em>Sobek</em>, Bodders glanced with more than casual interest at the life raft, the flares, and then – as we chatted in the saloon – side-eyed the Mayday card propped up by the VHF. This is all fair enough, and never annoys me, as I have plenty of ammunition of my own.</p>\n<p>Bodders has a colossal intellect, truly gigantic, all contained in a brain that I’m convinced goes all the way to the top of his massive thatch of hair. But this brain is so taken up with complex economics, deep thinking, meta- analysis, and dazzling wit, that there’s absolutely no room for the bit that remembers how to tie knots. Or steer.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100260\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100260\" class=\"wp-image-100260 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.col_guest_halls.11-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.col_guest_halls.11-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.col_guest_halls.11-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.col_guest_halls.11-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.col_guest_halls.11-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/01/YAM310.col_guest_halls.11.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100260\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Perfect conditions inspired Monty to turn simple sailing manoeuvres into slapstick comedy gold.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "New owner Monty Halls tests his sailing skills with his family aboard their Colvic 34 ketch, Sobek. A recently qualified Day Skipper, Monty faces a few unexpected challenges...\n\nThere are many folk who have stepped onto Sobek and made an immediate (although entirely understandable) mistake. They have assumed that I know what I’m doing. It’s not a long-lasting sensation, but in the early stages, it can be a bit discombobulating for all concerned.\nBut this certainly couldn’t be said of my best mate, a dear old mucker of nearly 40 years. He’s seen it all, every level of muppetry imaginable, and always has the air of a spooked animal whenever I invite him to try something where I’m in charge. This changes to a bovine acceptance of imminent death once we’re underway, and then sheer, unadulterated, unfettered joy when I give up and turn for home.\nAnd so as he stepped aboard Sobek, Bodders glanced with more than casual interest at the life raft, the flares, and then – as we chatted in the saloon – side-eyed the Mayday card propped up by the VHF. This is all fair enough, and never annoys me, as I have plenty of ammunition of my own.\nBodders has a colossal intellect, truly gigantic, all contained in a brain that I’m convinced goes all the way to the top of his massive thatch of hair. But this brain is so taken up with complex economics, deep thinking, meta- analysis, and dazzling wit, that there’s absolutely no room for the bit that remembers how to tie knots. Or steer.\n\nPerfect conditions inspired Monty to turn simple sailing manoeuvres into slapstick comedy gold. Photo: Monty Halls\n\nI’ve been teaching Bodders a clove hitch for four decades now, and – fair play to him – he’ll always give it a crack, but invariably ends up with his thumb secured firmly to the rail and the fender rolling at his feet.\nA few weeks ago, we set out, this unlikely duo, to do a bit of ‘pointlessly sailing in triangles’ off Slapton.

Toggle through the light settings by clicking the button and then shaking it for an alternative setting.</p>\n<p>It has a long battery life and is USB charged. It can also act as a small powerbank too as it has two USB slots, one for charging it and one for something external.</p>\n<p>The hanging hook is also really useful and the state of charge can be seen with a row of little lights that gradually reduce in number until the unit dims to let you know its time to charge it.</p>\n<p>It comes in either a 250-lumen intensity or 500 lumens, and takes 3 hours to recharge. It has an IPX4 rating so it can withstand rain and splashing.

In a water sealed metal body, this USB C rechargeable headlamp has enough power to seemingly light up the moon! (ok, 168m, but for a multifunction head torch, that&#8217;s excellent) It has plenty of less powerful options too so as not to burn your retina off in a small enclosed space. Now it also has a dedicated red light and separate switches for both red and white, so no toggling around looking for the correct light mode. The red is adjustable in brightness too, from a gentle dim red to a whoa there goes Santa ! bright red beam that would illuminate the top of even the tallest of masts. It has a replaceable headstrap with a removable centre support strap, which I&#8217;ve removed due to vanity,  because it was interfering with my hair style.<br />\nThis headtorch was Bruce Jacobs (Skipper/owner or Rubicon adventure yachts) headtorch of choice and now, I suspect it has become mine.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Stuck for a gift idea for the sailor in your life? We choose the best gifts for outdoor enthusiasts and for the adventurous \n\nStuck wondering what to buy for the sailor or sailing enthusiast in your life? Picking the right gift for a sailor can be tricky, so we’ve picked out the best gifts for sailors as chosen by the Yachting Monthly team!\nWe have searched through our best-on-test boating gear of the past 12 months to pick the perfect gift for the sailor in your life. Everything included in this list is something the editorial team – passionate sailors all – would like to receive as a gift, so you can be sure that this is a list of truly useful and interesting gifts for sailors and cruisers.\nNot everyone is on the same budget, so we have sectioned our gift guide by price, you can skip to each section below.\nBest sailing gifts under £100\nBest sailing gifts £100-500\nBest sailing gifts £500+\n\n\n \nBest gifts for sailors under £100\n \n\n1 / Ticket to the Moon Original Hammock\nWhat better way to get you through the winter evenings than imagining lazing in a hammock on your own boat? Made in Bali, Indonesia, Ticket to the Moon hammocks are free of PFCs and other harmful chemicals, and are ethically made. It’s lightweight and packs into a tiny pouch. Yes those are my trotters enjoying the hammock in Southampton on the rare sunny day we occasionally have.\nConstructed using skin-friendly OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 parachute silk nylon, they are designed to be light and portable, and come with a 10-year guarantee, and their own pouch.\n\n \n\n2 / Merino Wool Buff\nOff on a Christmas day hike? Buy the person you love a merino wool buff. It will be truly a gift that keeps giving.\nI have 7 buffs or so in various thicknesses and I wear them all, year round. Plus if I receive a new one for Christmas, it doesn’t matter that I already have one, these things are like socks. You can never have too many.\n \n\n \n \n\n3 / Gerber EZ Out Rescue Knife\nThe Gerber EZ-Out is one of our favourite sailing knives, and has featured at the top of our knife group gear tests due to its cutting ability; it scythed through Dyneema halyard, webbing or polypropylene line in seconds.\nThe 7.8cm-long single blade has a rounded tip, and is easy and safe to open one-handed. The blade locks well and is easily returned via a push point on the rear. At 73.7g, the EZ-Out Rescue is very light and comes with a lifetime guarantee.\n\n \n\n4 / Tribord Floating Sunglasses Polarised UV Protection\nDecathlon’s designers have developed these Tribord glasses for sailing and nautical activities.\nFloating glasses with polarised category-3 lenses for 100% UV protection filter out glare from the surface of the water.\nPractical if dropped, they float.\nThe wraparound style protects your eyes from all directions.\nAvailable in black with electric blue lenses or with petrol blue frames and matt black lenses.\n\n \n \n\n5 / Chatham Men’s Sperrin Boat Shoes\nAn autumnal twist to Chatham’s classic boat shoe, the Sperrin is made from soft leather and features antibacterial performance cushioning so you could wear them without socks when the weather gets warmer. The sole also has shock absorption, which promises comfort no matter what surface you walk over.\nThis rugged shoe has three-eyelet laces, side lace and contrast stitching detail. The heavy cleated sole has flex and grip, which is especially useful on wet pontoon surfaces or decks. It is available in tan or dark brown and in sizes 6-15. A women’s version is also available in tan, sizes 3-8.\n\n \n\n6 / BioLite Alpenglow\nI absolutely LOVE my BioLite lantern. It has a bright white light, which easily can be switched to an amber light. Shake the lantern and it will switch over to flickering candle effect. Toggle through the light settings by clicking the button and then shaking it for an alternative setting.\nIt has a long battery life and is USB charged. It can also act as a small powerbank too as it has two USB slots, one for charging it and one for something external.\nThe hanging hook is also really useful and the state of charge can be seen with a row of little lights that gradually reduce in number until the unit dims to let you know its time to charge it.\nIt comes in either a 250-lumen intensity or 500 lumens, and takes 3 hours to recharge. It has an IPX4 rating so it can withstand rain and splashing. It also features a useful fold-out hook for hanging from the boom or inside the saloon.\n\n \nBest Christmas gifts for sailors from £100-£500\n\n7 / Fenix HM65R Shadowmaster headtorch\nWOW, WOW, WOW, this head torch recently came to me for testing and I am blown away by it. In a water sealed metal body, this USB C rechargeable headlamp has enough power to seemingly light up the moon! (ok, 168m, but for a multifunction head torch, that’s excellent) It has plenty of less powerful options too so as not to burn your retina off in a small enclosed space. Now it also has a dedicated red light and separate switches for both red and white, so no toggling around looking for the correct light mode. The red is adjustable in brightness too, from a gentle dim red to a whoa there goes Santa ! bright red beam that would illuminate the top of even the tallest of masts. It has a replaceable headstrap with a removable centre support strap, which I’ve removed due to vanity,  because it was interfering with my hair style.\n\n \n\n8 / Spinlock Deckvest 6D lifejacket\nThis is the sixth generation of Spinlock’s Deckvest design, and came top in our best lifejacket test earlier this year. At 1.3kg, it is heavier than some other lifejackets, but is comfortable.\nIt has a sprayhood and can be fitted with a small stowage pocket for a personal locator beacon or a knife. It is available to buy with a standard harness or with an easily reset harness release system, which enables the wearer to disconnect from the safety line by releasing a lever behind the soft loop safety line attachment point of the lifejacket harness.\n\n \n \n\n9 / Gerber Center-Drive Multitool\nThis brilliant Gerber multitool has the centre drive screw driver and the smart sprung loaded pliers slide in or out with one hand. I’ve used these up a mast and balanced precariously on the end of a boom fishing out a bit of trapped reef line. A fabulous gift for someone practical.\n\n\n\n\n\n10 /Garmin InReach Mini 2 satellite tracker and messenger\nFor the adventurer in your life, give them the gift of track and traceability. From hiking the Appalachian trail to sailing offshore out of sight of land. There’s a whole array of ways this little device can help you and the ones you love to communicate and feel a little bit safer with it’s SOS capability.\nIt does require a subscription after purchase but you only need to activate that when the device is going to be used. It really is a tiny device with a mighty capability.\n\n \n \n\n11 / Helly Hansen Foil Jacket\nThis sleek sailing jacket is made with recycled materials. The HP Foil Sailing Jacket is lightweight, at just 575g, with a 3-layer, waterproof/breathable Helly Tech Performance construction in combination with PFC-free, water- repellent treatment to keep sea spray out.\nExtra features include a high-vis packable hood, adjustable cuffs, two hand pockets with brushed lining, a one-hand adjustable hem and a D-ring for a kill cord. All seams are fully sealed. It is made from recycled fabric made up of reused plastics that would have become marine debris.\n\n \n\n12 / Cobb Premier Air Charcoal Barbecue Grill\nThe award-winning Cobb is a versatile barbecue as it can roast, bake, fry, boil and smoke food too. It has an insulated surround guard which means it is cool to\nJust a few charcoal briquettes will give a cooking time of up to three hours. The Cobb’s design means fat and oil drain off into a reservoir so it doesn’t create the smoke and spit of conventional barbecues. It is completely portable and comes with its own carry bag.\n\n \n\n13 / ACR Resqlink 400 406MHZ GPS Buoyant PLB\nNothing says “I love you” more than a personal locator beacon as a gift! I know a few sailing couples who have gifted them to each other at Christmas time or for birthdays.\nSmall but resilient, the ResQLink 400 is a buoyant Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) that does not require any subscription for use and fits into the palm of your hands.\nWith three levels of integrated signal technology – GPS positioning, a powerful 406 MHz signal, and 121.5 MHz homing capability – the ResQLink 400 quickly and accurately relays your position to a worldwide network of search and rescue satellites.\nFor other perwsonal locator beacons, I’ve written about those in the buyers guide to personal locator beacons. \n\n \nBest Christmas gifts for sailors over £500\n\n14 / Musto MPX Gortex Offshore Oilskins Foul weather gear\nThe Musto MPX Collection was improved with an updated fit for 2021, with the jacket getting a darted sleeve construction for enhanced articulation, whilst the trousers were redesigned with a 200g reduction in weight.\nArticulated knee and seat reinforcements combine a full spectrum of motion with enhanced durability.\nConstructed from cutting-edge 3-layer GORE-TEX Pro fabric for remarkable waterproof, windproof and durable protection, that’s also incredibly breathable to keep you comfortable in all weather.\nThe jacket features a heat retentive grid fleece lined funnel and hood pod with a highly protective, adjustable spume.\nThese offshore waterproofs are available in black, blue, red and ‘platinum’ grey.\n\n \n\n15 / Garmin Quatix 7 Watch\nThe Quatix 7 is an all round genius wearable that allows a huge range of monitoring activities, including your health as well as practical functions to control and interact with marine tech.

It weighed two hundredweight (100kg) and had clearly been used as a mooring root, as one fluke had already been removed. It was ideal for my purposes except that its stock had gone, so I had a length of scaffold pole welded to it.\nCross-beam\nThis is simply two pieces of 3ftx6in timber planking bolted together to form a cross. Some boat owners use railway sleepers for this purpose, but the extra weight they offer isn’t really necessary as the cross-beam is held in place by the suction and the depth of mud atop it.\\\n\nCumbersome but effective!\n\nNeed to know legalities\nYou need to contact the local council, yacht club or whoever controls the foreshore (which is actually owned by the Crown Estate). They will, or should, allocate you a location. Normally you should make sure your root spot is at least 30 yards from the nearest next root spot. You can pace this out as a circle. Charges are negligible for drying moorings. It’s about £150 annually for Southend foreshore.\nIt’s also worth noting that while etiquette might suggest otherwise, there are no laws stopping others using your mooring and, what’s more, if somebody picks up your mooring and it fails then you are liable.\n\nDesign for a self-dug mooring\n\nMooring size and design\nYou can probably get away with a single root for drying moorings for most craft up to 30ft LOA. Over that you might want to put down two roots connected with a bridle to which the riser chain is attached.\nAt the top of the mooring, you’ll need a large buoy holding the rising chain (which stays in the water) and a smaller pick-up buoy with a light line made fast to two hefty nylon mooring strops.\nMaintenance\nThe root and chain beneath the mud last indefinitely as no air gets to them so they do not need to be lifted. But you need to check on the swivel – which is attached to the top end of the ground chain – and also the riser chain, which will degrade. You’ll need to do this every year. Some people remove the swivel and riser chain during the winter to cut back on wear and tear.\nEnjoyed reading this?\nA subscription to Yachting Monthly magazine costs around 40% less than the cover price, so you can save money compared to buying single issues.\nPrint and digital editions are available through Magazines Direct – where you can also find the latest deals.\nYM is packed with information to help you get the most from your time on the water.\nTake your seamanship to the next level with tips, advice and skills from our experts\nImpartial in-depth reviews of the latest yachts and equipment\nCruising guides to help you reach those dream destinations\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\nThe post How to lay your own mooring appeared first on Yachting Monthly.",

It is a big stretch to leave the dock after just three days with a boat full of scientists, campaigners, and crew. But it is the only way to do the job.</p>\n<p>With a genoa, a yankee and a staysail on a manual roller furling, it’s necessary to have a plan before we unfurl the sails. It takes three to five minutes and a lot of human energy to get them in and out. The mainsail is don’t ask me why – square-topped and can’t be gybed or tacked without putting the first of four reefs in to avoid it being caught in the backstay.</p>\n<p>So we end up always sailing with one reef. But after playing around with combinations of the three foresails, <em>Witness</em> proves to be a fast-moving boat and, when the following breeze kicks up to a healthy 25-30 knots, she speeds like a freight train along the Norwegian coast towards Ålesund.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100212\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100212\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100212\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/12/YAM309.feat_greenpeace_8pg.25_hydrophone-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/12/YAM309.feat_greenpeace_8pg.25_hydrophone-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/12/YAM309.feat_greenpeace_8pg.25_hydrophone-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/12/YAM309.feat_greenpeace_8pg.25_hydrophone-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/12/YAM309.feat_greenpeace_8pg.25_hydrophone-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/12/YAM309.feat_greenpeace_8pg.25_hydrophone.jpg 1654w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100212\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The oil-filled tube contains four hydrophones for listening to whales.

On <em>Witness</em>, I have two mates, an engineer and a deckhand to help me run the ship. The mates and I do a four to eight-hour shift rotation, and I have the eight to 12 shift twice a day. This schedule is inherited from former skippers, and it is a luxury to sleep the whole night through. The engineer and deckhand fill in on the night shifts while the scientists run their shift system with two on deck watching for whales and listening on the hydrophones.</p>\n<p>We cross the Arctic Circle at 66° 33’ N and celebrate with cake and round-the-clock daylight. Now there is no excuse not to keep a lookout for whales, but we all have to sleep. So the sailors also look and listen for whales on their sunny night shifts.</p>\n<p><em>Witness</em> is a full-on sailing boat capable of doing 200 nautical miles a day in the right conditions. However, even when the going is easy, it isn’t possible for us to do that. We have to push through wind and waves to get somewhere on time.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_100201\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-100201\" class=\"size-large wp-image-100201\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/12/YAM309.feat_greenpeace_8pg.05_arcticsunrise-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/12/YAM309.feat_greenpeace_8pg.05_arcticsunrise-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/12/YAM309.feat_greenpeace_8pg.05_arcticsunrise-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/12/YAM309.feat_greenpeace_8pg.05_arcticsunrise-768x432.jpg 768w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/12/YAM309.feat_greenpeace_8pg.05_arcticsunrise-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/12/YAM309.feat_greenpeace_8pg.05_arcticsunrise.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-100201\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A white night in the open waters outside Svalbard where Witness meets icebreaker Arctic Sunrise.

We are here to fight for the ocean, but ironically, this means that we cannot always sail. But we do try. Because the feeling we get when the engine goes silent and you can hear the saltwater slushing by on the other side of the eight-millimetre aluminium hull is priceless.</p>\n<p>On this deep-sea mission, it means that we can’t sail at 4 knots when the ideal speed for the hydrophone is 6-9 knots. We have to break the silence with the engine, and we have a huge area to cover in a zig-zag pattern. So we are happy when we can roll out the sails, and focus on the ocean view when we have to roll them in again.

For Greenpeace, that makes good sense. After all, saving the planet is all about communication, and in today’s world, speed and availability are rules one and two.</p>\n<p>So we send pictures, videos, and text back home to the office. Good as it is, though, connectivity is a double-edged sword. One of the reasons I sail the ocean is to get away from the world.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Norwegian journalist Jon Amtrup skippers Greenpeace vessel Witness to the Arctic Circle on a scientific expedition to monitor ecosystems ahead of possible deep-sea mining in the Norwegian Sea\n\nStepping aboard the 74-foot aluminium lifting keel expedition vessel in Bergen, I stroke the rugged pilothouse gently and whisper, ‘Hello, friend.’ I know that skippering Witness is going to be a stretch. More precisely, a 23ft-long stretch beyond the largest sailing yacht I have skippered until then.\nWitness is a massive little ship and that added length seems like a mile.\nWitness is the former Pelagic Australis, the brainchild of high-latitude sailing legend Skip Novak. At 74 feet long and weighing in at over 50 tonnes, she is built for 12 people to live in comfortably and be self-sufficient for weeks in the cold, icy climates at the ends of the world.\nShe carries seven tonnes of diesel and three tonnes of water. In her former life, she has sailed scientists, climbers, skiers, TV crews, and explorers to Antarctica, South Georgia, Patagonia and the Arctic, and navigated various remote islands in the middle of high seas and screaming winds.\nIn 2021, Greenpeace launched Witness in their colours after a major donor gave the ship to the environmental organisation. For the next three months, I would be the skipper and we were going in my favourite direction: north.\n\nJon Amtrup, skipper and writer, adjusting sails somewhere between Jan Mayen and Bear Island. Photo: Jon Amtrup\n\nThe longest stretch\nThe handover process takes three days and with every point on the list we go through, I get more and more relieved that I have a crew of four – two mates, an engineer, and a deckhand – who know the ship, procedures, and Greenpeace well. It is a big stretch to leave the dock after just three days with a boat full of scientists, campaigners, and crew. But it is the only way to do the job.\nWith a genoa, a yankee and a staysail on a manual roller furling, it’s necessary to have a plan before we unfurl the sails. It takes three to five minutes and a lot of human energy to get them in and out. The mainsail is don’t ask me why – square-topped and can’t be gybed or tacked without putting the first of four reefs in to avoid it being caught in the backstay.\nSo we end up always sailing with one reef. But after playing around with combinations of the three foresails, Witness proves to be a fast-moving boat and, when the following breeze kicks up to a healthy 25-30 knots, she speeds like a freight train along the Norwegian coast towards Ålesund.\n\nThe oil-filled tube contains four hydrophones for listening to whales. Photo: Jon Amtrup\n\n‘Why have we fixed the spinnaker boom with the mousing lines? And why isn’t the running backstay on?’\nMy first mate Alessandra gives me a mild verbal keelhauling when the first morning light comes and it is time for a watch change.\n‘Sorry. I read the 100-page long manual but could not find the correct ropes in the forepeak. The running backstays I just forgot. Too much information, and too much “bursting to sail her” feeling,’ I try to explain. She just smiles and shakes her head. Forgiven. I hope.\n\nWitness is one of many sailing boats used for scientific work in an effort to save the ocean. Photo: Jon Amtrup\n\nOut to sea\nWe leave Ålesund as soon as our photographer has stepped on board. We have a mission. The scientists on board, spearheaded by the always energetic Dr. Kirsten Young, are eager to launch the hydrophone, which we will be towing 350 metres behind the boat. The four hydrophones in the oil-filled tube will pick up whales and dolphins speaking to each other in the deep.\nSailing with scientists who love to share their vast knowledge gives you a new perspective on the ocean we all love. I learn that it is mostly the male sperm whales that migrate north to feed. The young and female sperms tend to stay in the warm waters below 40° of latitude.\nArticle continues below…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nA guide to high latitude yachts\nYacht cruising within the Arctic Circle has become increasingly popular,  but what is the best type of yacht for the…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nHigh latitude cruising: How to sail to the Arctic\nSailing to the Arctic is on many a sailor's bucket list, but how possible is it for the average cruiser?…\n\n\nThe blue-grey giants seek out the highly productive and deep water in the Norwegian Sea, the same stretch of water where Norway is doing what Norway does best: exploiting ocean resources for the benefit of a few and the disaster of the many.\nIt started with the near extinction of whales, then overfishing, then we moved on to oil and gas and followed up with fish farming that is destroying fjords, fisheries, and oceans worldwide. As the fossil fuel era is slowly fading out, the Norwegian politicians have cast their desperate eyes on the deep sea where minerals are to be found.\nThe deep sea is one of the few areas on the planet we know very little about. Every time scientists send ROV (unmanned submarines) down to the deep they come up with pictures of new species. In best-case scenarios, the scientists reckon we only have discovered 10 per cent of what is living down there.\n\nLaunching the hydrophone. Photo: Jon Amtrup\n\nWhy are species we don’t know anything about so important? Whole ecosystems stand to be destroyed, and we know nothing about the consequences.\nDown there in the deep might live the key ingredients for a cure for cancer and more. The area is also a huge carbon sink that we might end up destroying, further disrupting the climate. It will take tens of years for scientists to map out these ecosystems properly. And that’s way beyond the political time horizon that just stretches to the next election.\nWith 12 people on board, the bunks are all full, but it never feels crowded. Even the non-sailors on board have recovered nicely after 24 hours at sea. For some, it’s their first time on board a sailing boat; what a baptism  sailing over 14 days in the Norwegian Sea heading for Longyearbyen, Svalbard. We are lucky, it could have been a rough experience, with gale after gale and nowhere to hide.\nThe thin volcanic island of Jan Mayen lies a couple of hundred miles away, but doesn’t really provide much in the way of shelter. If a storm had come along and forced us to seek shelter, the science expedition would have been over because it would take us three to four days to find a safe haven in either Svalbard, Iceland, or back in Norway.\n\nYou never know when icebergs will flip, so keep a safe distance. Photo: Jon Amtrup\n\nShift work\nI am the first and last person the scientists see every day, so they think I am always awake. On Witness, I have two mates, an engineer and a deckhand to help me run the ship. The mates and I do a four to eight-hour shift rotation, and I have the eight to 12 shift twice a day. This schedule is inherited from former skippers, and it is a luxury to sleep the whole night through. The engineer and deckhand fill in on the night shifts while the scientists run their shift system with two on deck watching for whales and listening on the hydrophones.\nWe cross the Arctic Circle at 66° 33’ N and celebrate with cake and round-the-clock daylight. Now there is no excuse not to keep a lookout for whales, but we all have to sleep. So the sailors also look and listen for whales on their sunny night shifts.\nWitness is a full-on sailing boat capable of doing 200 nautical miles a day in the right conditions. However, even when the going is easy, it isn’t possible for us to do that. We have to push through wind and waves to get somewhere on time.\n\nA white night in the open waters outside Svalbard where Witness meets icebreaker Arctic Sunrise. Photo: Jon Amtrup\n\nAlthough we are a sailing boat, we are primarily a provider of logistical services for scientists, Greenpeace campaigners, and storytellers. We are here to fight for the ocean, but ironically, this means that we cannot always sail. But we do try. Because the feeling we get when the engine goes silent and you can hear the saltwater slushing by on the other side of the eight-millimetre aluminium hull is priceless.\nOn this deep-sea mission, it means that we can’t sail at 4 knots when the ideal speed for the hydrophone is 6-9 knots. We have to break the silence with the engine, and we have a huge area to cover in a zig-zag pattern. So we are happy when we can roll out the sails, and focus on the ocean view when we have to roll them in again. And I keep a keen eye on the latest weather forecasts.\n\nCruising among the ice floes in Svalbard to get close to the fast-melting glaciers. Photo: Jon Amtrup\n\nSense of mission\nStarlink is a total game-changer when it comes to sailing. We have two on board just in case one of them should break down in a fit. For Greenpeace, that makes good sense. After all, saving the planet is all about communication, and in today’s world, speed and availability are rules one and two.\nSo we send pictures, videos, and text back home to the office. Good as it is, though, connectivity is a double-edged sword. One of the reasons I sail the ocean is to get away from the world. To be in my little blue bubble of happiness – or total misery when the storm hits. Either way, it’s better than being in the office. But Starlink enables meetings in all shapes and formats with the big blue surrounding us. Meetings with people who want change.\n\nLooking for sperm whales can be tiring work, but very rewarding when we spot them. Photo: Jon Amtrup\n\nAll sailors should be concerned about deep-sea mining. The ocean already faces many threats in the form of plastic pollution, acidification, and over-fishing, to name just a few, so we just can’t afford to put more strain on it. We are all dependent on a healthy ocean and shouldn’t allow a few companies to imperil it in the name of profit, says Haldis Tjeldflaat Helle of Greenpeace Norway.\nSailing for Greenpeace means that you are constantly surrounded by highly motivated, opinionated, and knowledgeable people about how we are increasingly destroying the planet we depend on. They are fighting for the ocean and the one planet we have. And when we arrive in Longyearbyen after 10 days filled with whales singing and diving, it is 22°C in the northernmost city in the world. Of course, it’s nice with a taste of summer, but that is scary hot. It should not be this hot, but the sad fact is that the Arctic is heating up way faster than the rest of the world.\n\nTail of a sperm whale.
