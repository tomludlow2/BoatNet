He is co-founder of Terahertz, an advanced engineering company which, among other impressive achievements, developed <a href=\"https://www.terahertz.co.uk/news/tk-instruments/94ghz-cloud-radar-integration-into-earthcare-underway\">remote sensing instruments</a> for the European Space Agency’s EarthCARE mission.

Mapping its subterranean cave network is “incredibly dangerous and physically challenging”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/cave-mapping-anno-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114995\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/cave-mapping-anno-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/cave-mapping-anno-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/cave-mapping-anno-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/cave-mapping-anno-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/cave-mapping-anno-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/cave-mapping-anno-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/cave-mapping-anno-900x675.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/cave-mapping-anno.jpg 2016w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Team Raspberry Shake&#8217;s kit, including a Raspberry Shake acoustic seismograph, oxygen tanks, and maps of remote and barely accessible stretches of cave systems</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Exploring the caves involves following taut lines of string with knots every ten feet to mark the way, just like Theseus in the Greek myth. Richard mentions the trust and focus needed to accurately read a compass and count out distances travelled ten feet at a time based on how many knots you’ve passed. Visibility and human physical resilience are all factors too — if you’re exhausted from a lengthy dive, you probably aren’t noticing arrows or counting knots accurately. “It’s milk of magnesia down there when the bubbles hit the ceiling.” &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richard explains the process: “We mark the depth, the distance and the azimuth, and the angle to the next station” — often simply where the line is wrapped around a rock. Painted arrows help ensure divers don’t get lost, but some caves have more than one entrance, or arrows pointing in more than one direction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"717\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Actun-Koh-cover-page-717x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114994\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Actun-Koh-cover-page-717x1024.png 717w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Actun-Koh-cover-page-210x300.png 210w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Actun-Koh-cover-page-768x1097.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Actun-Koh-cover-page-1076x1536.png 1076w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Actun-Koh-cover-page-800x1142.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Actun-Koh-cover-page-450x643.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Actun-Koh-cover-page-900x1285.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Actun-Koh-cover-page.png 1110w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Richard Wylde, Fred Devos, and colleagues published a booklet mapping  the cave system at Actun Koh</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The maps are written on specially printed paper and include geographical features such as cave openings, changes in cave and water depth, and height. Relating this information to the outside world requires a way of referring it to the surface and getting a GPS position from it. “The map is linked to an absolute position by taking the line out of the cave entrance and accessing a GPS coordinate in an area with few obstructions to the sky,” says Richard. “In caves which have more than one entrance, it is possible to ascertain and correct for the build-up of errors by taking GPS measurements at the entrances. Programs such as Ariane [a widely used mapping tool] can then be used to distribute the correction through the map.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Instrumental improvements</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The team previously used a fluxgate magnetometer to match above-ground and subterranean locations at the Sagitario cenote. In the summer of 2024, Richard and his cave-mapping colleagues trialled a new means of confirming their findings, using both the Raspberry Shake 1D vertical motion seismograph and a far more sensitive acoustic magnetometer. Getting to the site after hacking through the jungle, the Raspberry Shake and acoustic magnetoscope were placed directly above where divers believed the cave was located. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"687\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/golf-course-algae-1024x687.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114998\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/golf-course-algae-1024x687.png 1024w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/golf-course-algae-300x201.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/golf-course-algae-768x515.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/golf-course-algae-800x537.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/golf-course-algae-450x302.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/golf-course-algae-900x604.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/golf-course-algae.png 1069w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Golfing greens are treated with nitrates that poison the cenotes with algae</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>“Raspberry Shake helped confirm our findings and add a degree of accuracy that was not previously possible,” says Richard. The results were promising enough that the team ordered an RS3D three-axis model for their planned return trip in early 2025. This time, the Raspberry Shake will be placed in an IP67 waterproof box, and the team hopes the additional measurements will allow direction to be determined from the relative amplitudes of the disturbance in the X, Y, Z frames.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Chris_Sam_RJW_Sac_actun-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114996\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Chris_Sam_RJW_Sac_actun-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Chris_Sam_RJW_Sac_actun-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Chris_Sam_RJW_Sac_actun-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Chris_Sam_RJW_Sac_actun-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Chris_Sam_RJW_Sac_actun-800x1067.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Chris_Sam_RJW_Sac_actun-450x600.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Chris_Sam_RJW_Sac_actun-900x1200.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Chris_Sam_RJW_Sac_actun-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Richard, Sam, and Chris embark on a cave dive at Actun Koh</figcaption></figure></div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/cave-mapping-with-raspberry-shake/\">Cave mapping with Raspberry Shake</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com\">Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>\n",

Visibility and human physical resilience are all factors too — if you’re exhausted from a lengthy dive, you probably aren’t noticing arrows or counting knots accurately. “It’s milk of magnesia down there when the bubbles hit the ceiling.”  \nRichard explains the process: “We mark the depth, the distance and the azimuth, and the angle to the next station” — often simply where the line is wrapped around a rock. Painted arrows help ensure divers don’t get lost, but some caves have more than one entrance, or arrows pointing in more than one direction. \n\n\n\n\nRichard Wylde, Fred Devos, and colleagues published a booklet mapping  the cave system at Actun Koh\nThe maps are written on specially printed paper and include geographical features such as cave openings, changes in cave and water depth, and height. Relating this information to the outside world requires a way of referring it to the surface and getting a GPS position from it. “The map is linked to an absolute position by taking the line out of the cave entrance and accessing a GPS coordinate in an area with few obstructions to the sky,” says Richard. “In caves which have more than one entrance, it is possible to ascertain and correct for the build-up of errors by taking GPS measurements at the entrances. Programs such as Ariane [a widely used mapping tool] can then be used to distribute the correction through the map.”\nInstrumental improvements\nThe team previously used a fluxgate magnetometer to match above-ground and subterranean locations at the Sagitario cenote. In the summer of 2024, Richard and his cave-mapping colleagues trialled a new means of confirming their findings, using both the Raspberry Shake 1D vertical motion seismograph and a far more sensitive acoustic magnetometer. Getting to the site after hacking through the jungle, the Raspberry Shake and acoustic magnetoscope were placed directly above where divers believed the cave was located. \n\n\n\n\nGolfing greens are treated with nitrates that poison the cenotes with algae\n“Raspberry Shake helped confirm our findings and add a degree of accuracy that was not previously possible,” says Richard. The results were promising enough that the team ordered an RS3D three-axis model for their planned return trip in early 2025. This time, the Raspberry Shake will be placed in an IP67 waterproof box, and the team hopes the additional measurements will allow direction to be determined from the relative amplitudes of the disturbance in the X, Y, Z frames. \n\n\n\n\nRichard, Sam, and Chris embark on a cave dive at Actun Koh\nThe post Cave mapping with Raspberry Shake appeared first on Raspberry Pi.",

Home Assistant is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi as the sole service. It is possible to run Home Assistant alongside other apps and services, but we’re keeping to the true path here. Home Assistant works with Raspberry Pi 3, but we strongly recommend using a Raspberry Pi 4 for the best performance.

It will also create a default dashboard for you based on what’s been found. Not all integrations can be found automatically, so you can browse available integrations and add them yourself or install third-party add-ons.

    "content:encoded": "\n<p><strong><em>A very rewarding thing about designing affordable hardware is watching young makers grow up with it, sometimes taking their interest in computing to university and beyond. We&#8217;ve seen kids who began playing around with Raspberry Pi go on to use our devices in their professional lives — in fact, that&#8217;s how a couple of our own engineers started out. In <a href=\"https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/issues/149\">issue 149</a> of <a href=\"https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/\">The MagPi</a>, we spoke to the three siblings behind the </em><strong>GurgleApps</strong> <em>YouTube channel. They&#8217;ve been sharing STEM projects for ten years now.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve been covering projects from the team of siblings who make up <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@GurgleApps\">GurgleApps</a> for a long time — most recently their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gurgleapps.com/reviews/electronics/wifi-controlled-color-word-clock-kit-micropython\">Colour Word Clock</a> (<em>image below</em>) — and they themselves have been using a Raspberry Pi since the year it came out. In fact, it helped turn them into the makers they are today.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/wordclock-with-new-matrix-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114663\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Buy your own <a href=\"https://gurgleapps.com/reviews/electronics/wifi-controlled-color-word-clock-kit-micropython\">Colour Word Clock</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>“Making became a part of our lives largely due to the influence of our parents, who filled our home with electronics, science, and coding projects,” the GurgleApps trio tell us. “Funnily enough, we weren’t hooked immediately — we had all this amazing equipment and knowledge at home, but took it for granted. The real spark came when Caleb received his first Raspberry Pi in 2012. Our dad playfully ‘forgot’ to tell us about the startx command, so we spent the first month working solely in the terminal, using simple commands like top and programming in Vi (a text editor) to create quiz and adventure games — without realising there was a graphical interface! It was rather frustrating for us at the time, but as our dad reminded us, it was nothing compared to his old ZX Spectrum.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How did you start making videos together?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We started making videos together somewhat accidentally in 2015. It all kicked off with a prank on our dad where we used a Raspberry Pi to SSH into his computer and close the app he was working on. Amélie demonstrated the prank using simple shell commands, while Caleb handled the filming. Since we were too young for social media, we posted the video on our parents’ account. Unexpectedly, it went viral, gathering 1.4 million views! The overwhelming support inspired us to create more content, leading to the birth of our channel, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@GurgleApps\">GurgleApps</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/gurgle-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114662\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Subscribe to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@GurgleApps\">GurgleApps on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, we noticed that many students — including us — were missing out on hands-on science experiments. We started recreating school physics experiments at home and sharing tutorials on our channel. This allowed others to keep learning and exploring STEM subjects despite the circumstances. We’re dedicated to making STEM education accessible and fun for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What was your first group maker project?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our first significant group project was creating the Pico Piano (<em>watch below</em>).

    "content:encodedSnippet": "A very rewarding thing about designing affordable hardware is watching young makers grow up with it, sometimes taking their interest in computing to university and beyond. We’ve seen kids who began playing around with Raspberry Pi go on to use our devices in their professional lives — in fact, that’s how a couple of our own engineers started out. In issue 149 of The MagPi, we spoke to the three siblings behind the GurgleApps YouTube channel. They’ve been sharing STEM projects for ten years now.\nWe’ve been covering projects from the team of siblings who make up GurgleApps for a long time — most recently their Colour Word Clock (image below) — and they themselves have been using a Raspberry Pi since the year it came out. In fact, it helped turn them into the makers they are today.\n\n\n\n\nBuy your own Colour Word Clock\n“Making became a part of our lives largely due to the influence of our parents, who filled our home with electronics, science, and coding projects,” the GurgleApps trio tell us. “Funnily enough, we weren’t hooked immediately — we had all this amazing equipment and knowledge at home, but took it for granted. The real spark came when Caleb received his first Raspberry Pi in 2012. Our dad playfully ‘forgot’ to tell us about the startx command, so we spent the first month working solely in the terminal, using simple commands like top and programming in Vi (a text editor) to create quiz and adventure games — without realising there was a graphical interface! It was rather frustrating for us at the time, but as our dad reminded us, it was nothing compared to his old ZX Spectrum.”\nHow did you start making videos together?\nWe started making videos together somewhat accidentally in 2015. It all kicked off with a prank on our dad where we used a Raspberry Pi to SSH into his computer and close the app he was working on. Amélie demonstrated the prank using simple shell commands, while Caleb handled the filming. Since we were too young for social media, we posted the video on our parents’ account. Unexpectedly, it went viral, gathering 1.4 million views! The overwhelming support inspired us to create more content, leading to the birth of our channel, GurgleApps.\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to GurgleApps on YouTube\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we noticed that many students — including us — were missing out on hands-on science experiments. We started recreating school physics experiments at home and sharing tutorials on our channel. This allowed others to keep learning and exploring STEM subjects despite the circumstances. We’re dedicated to making STEM education accessible and fun for everyone.\nWhat was your first group maker project?\nOur first significant group project was creating the Pico Piano (watch below). We built it using a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller and designed our own circuit board right at home. To make the circuit board, we used a DIY method: drawing the circuit design on a copper board with Sharpies and then etching it using ferric chloride. This hands-on process was both challenging and exciting, as it combined electronics, coding, and a bit of chemistry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow has the channel affected your lives?\nRunning our YouTube channel has taught us a wide range of skills — from presenting and video editing to live-streaming and valuable maker and business skills.

    "content:encoded": "\n<p>At Raspberry Pi, we have always been keen to do things that are more sustainable. Our products are intrinsically small and low-power, which makes them efficient in terms of resource usage (materials, shipping, electricity); Raspberry Pi devices can replace more resource-hungry solutions in many applications that would traditionally use a legacy x86 PC, such as digital signage. They also enable innovative approaches to improving the environment or people’s lives – including, of course, Raspberry Pi&#8217;s founding mission to make cheap computers and computing resources readily available to all to support learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Raspberry Pi <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-ipo/\">floated on the London Stock Exchange on 11 June 2024</a>, we were proud to be awarded the LSE’s <a href=\"https://www.londonstockexchange.com/raise-finance/sustainable-finance/green-economy-mark\">Green Economy Mark</a>. The Mark recognises that not only are our products efficient in terms of resource usage, they also enable the displacement of other, less sustainable, technologies.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1136-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-110030\" style=\"width:840px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1136-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1136-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1136-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1136-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1136-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1136-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1136-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1136-450x338.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1136-900x675.jpeg 900w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Raspberry Pi joins the London Stock Exchange</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve also worked to reduce the environmental impact of our manufacturing and shipping. Over time we have reduced our use of plastic packaging and shrunk product carton and shipper sizes, as well as working on more efficient production methods such as the new intrusive reflow soldering process for Raspberry Pi 5. The latter both saves energy and reduces the physical manufacturing footprint at the factory, while increasing throughput. As well as benefitting the environment, all of these initiatives improve our products&#8217; cost structure, increasing efficiency and allowing us to keep our prices lower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we are a public limited company, we have formalised the role of sustainability within the business, with a Sustainability Committee to oversee activities like these. The committee monitors our performance using various metrics such as CO₂ emissions and materials use, comes up with future targets, and challenges the team to develop a strategy to achieve them. Raspberry Pi aims to be a leader in sustainable practices within the technology sector while maintaining our core focus on providing affordable and accessible technology for all. Below we explore the key principles that guide our sustainability strategy, and look at how we calculate our impact in terms of carbon emissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Guiding principles for sustainable practices</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Raspberry Pi is firmly committed to sustainability alongside our responsibility to our shareholders. Our commitment is driven by the beliefs of our founders, our team, and the Raspberry Pi Foundation, our largest shareholder and a charity focused on digital skills education. Customers quite rightly value credible and meaningful sustainability initiatives, which often have an important positive impact on brand reputation and market share, and we are able to balance these activities with the need to perform in a price-sensitive market. It goes without saying that we will adhere to all UK sustainability laws and regulations transparently, and we will also monitor voluntary best practices and adopt them where we can.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as monitoring and reducing our own CO₂ footprint, we are conscious of emissions generated by the many third parties we rely on for supply of materials and services – components, shipping, and so on. Encouraging suppliers to reduce their environmental impact is central to Raspberry Pi&#8217;s approach, and we are beginning to engage with all our suppliers, asking them to quantify the carbon content in their products. Over time we will consider the &#8220;carbon cost&#8221; of what we purchase (broadly, the cost of an equivalent high-quality carbon offset), as well as the base item cost, when we do our costing calculations. So, for example, a diode from one manufacturer may appear cheaper than one from another manufacturer, but if the carbon cost of the first is higher, we would take this into account and might choose the second. Over time this will favour lower-carbon solutions and encourage manufacturers to supply lower-carbon products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Raspberry Pi prioritises keeping our products affordable and accessible, empowering customers to make informed choices about offsetting their own carbon footprint. This allows us to maintain profitability and maximise our contribution to the Raspberry Pi Foundation&#8217;s charitable mission, which remains a core objective for the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"A tale of two Raspberry Pis\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EoSPR_dZnYg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Measuring emissions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s imporant that our sustainability efforts are both transparent and accountable. To this end, we are actively measuring our carbon footprint across what are known as Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, and we have developed a methodology to assess our environmental impact as accurately as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scope 1 and 2 emissions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scope 1 </strong>emissions are the direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by a company, while <strong>Scope 2 </strong>emissions are indirect emissions from generating the energy that the company purchases. Scope 2 includes emissions from electricity, heating, and cooling that the company consumes; although the company doesn&#8217;t produce these emissions directly, it is still responsible for them because they result from its energy consumption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Raspberry Pi, Scope 1 and 2 are lumped together, since we don’t have any energy-generating assets that emit carbon. We measure these emissions via the energy bills for our various offices and shops.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scope 3 emissions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scope 3 emissions</strong> encompass all the other indirect emissions that occur in a company&#8217;s value chain. This is the broadest category; it includes emissions from upstream activities like the production and transportation of raw materials, as well as downstream activities like the use and disposal of products. Scope 3 emissions also cover employee commuting, business travel, and waste generated in a company&#8217;s operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We divide the measurement of Scope 3 emissions into two categories: emissions due to <em>products </em>that we make to sell, and <em>other </em>carbon emissions generated through our business activities. As we are a company that sells millions of computers and accessories every year, our product emissions are especially important to understand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding carbon emissions from Raspberry Pi products</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a method for evaluating the environmental impact of a product throughout its life, from sourcing the materials used to make it through to disposing of it. We assess emissions for all our products across all of their LCA phases except for customer usage of the product. The diagram below shows the different phases in a product&#8217;s life cycle:</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Picture1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114515\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Picture1.png 940w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Picture1-300x38.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Picture1-768x98.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Picture1-800x102.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Picture1-450x57.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Picture1-900x115.png 900w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To assess the environmental impact of our products, we worked with our partner <a href=\"https://inhabit.eco/\">Inhabit</a> to conduct a comprehensive study, following the <a href=\"https://ghgprotocol.org/\">Greenhouse Gas Protocol</a> and <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/38498.html\">ISO 14044:2006</a> standards. We used industry-leading tools from Inhabit together with the <a href=\"https://ecoinvent.org/\">EcoInvent</a> database to calculate the carbon footprint of products throughout their lifecycle. This involved carrying out a detailed analysis of a set of individual, representative products across our range, then applying the results to other, similar products.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Calculating individual product carbon emissions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>How do we calculate the carbon emitted when a product is manufactured? In a nutshell, we first take every item in the product’s Bill of Materials (BOM) and find the carbon emitted during its production (called its embodied carbon), and add up all these emissions. We then take account of the carbon used to make the product in the factory as well as the carbon emitted during shipping (both shipping of the materials to make the product, and shipping of the finished product). Finally, we add on a number representing the carbon we expect will be emitted when the product is disposed of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may sound like a fairly simple step-by-step process, but finding the exact quantity of embodied carbon for every item of a product&#8217;s BOM is not easy – in most cases you can’t (yet) just ask a manufacturer what the embodied carbon is in their capacitor or diode or PCB or other widget. So how do we do it? The simple answer is averages: lots of them, in a database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We map every item in a product&#8217;s BOM to a category in an officially recognised database which contains the average embedded carbon for many, many categories; there may be a category for the average small signal diode or capacitor, or for the production of steel plate, and so on. Often these figures are provided by mass – a certain quantity of carbon emitted per unit mass of the product – which means we need to know the mass of each component. Where there are no good matches for a particular item, we might need to look at that item&#8217;s own BOM, calculating the mass of the various materials in a connector, for example, and using yet more averages for the plastic, metals, and processes involved in order to estimate its embodied carbon.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/03/SONY_FACTORY_2020__015-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-107044\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/03/SONY_FACTORY_2020__015-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/03/SONY_FACTORY_2020__015-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/03/SONY_FACTORY_2020__015-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/03/SONY_FACTORY_2020__015-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/03/SONY_FACTORY_2020__015-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/03/SONY_FACTORY_2020__015-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/03/SONY_FACTORY_2020__015-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/03/SONY_FACTORY_2020__015-900x600.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Raspberry Pi hardware is manufactured at Sony&#8217;s facility in Pencoed, south Wales</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For the carbon emitted in factory production, we can use real data provided by our contract manufacturer Sony, and for shipping we also have quite a lot of real data to hand. For product end-of-life, we have to turn to averages once more and add on the average carbon cost of disposal; again, these figures come from an officially recognised database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I explained above, we do these detailed calculations for a representative subset of our products, and then we scale the carbon footprint calculations proportionally for products with similar designs or varying sizes. We have also categorised certain items which sell in smaller quantities as &#8220;de minimis&#8221;: for these products, we have estimated their environmental impact by applying to them the average CO₂ emissions per dollar of revenue across our calculated products. This has allowed us to provide a comprehensive carbon footprint assessment for our entire product range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, the total emissions per product are combined with our yearly sales number for each product to give us our final estimate of Scope 3 carbon emissions in the <em>product</em> category across our business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other Scope 3 emissions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote earlier in this article that we divide Scope 3 carbon emissions into two categories: <em>product</em> emissions and <em>other</em> emissions. To calculate emissions for the <em>other</em> Scope 3 items, we take all the non-product transactions for the year from our accounting journals, and assign a category to each one. Then we can link this category to average emissions per pound spent; these average figures are drawn, once more, from the EcoInvent database. This allows us to convert the money we have spent with a business into a carbon emission figure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining all of our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions gives us a yearly emissions figure. For 2024, this will be reported in our inaugural annual report in April 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can we rely on the results?

    "content:encodedSnippet": "At Raspberry Pi, we have always been keen to do things that are more sustainable. Our products are intrinsically small and low-power, which makes them efficient in terms of resource usage (materials, shipping, electricity); Raspberry Pi devices can replace more resource-hungry solutions in many applications that would traditionally use a legacy x86 PC, such as digital signage. They also enable innovative approaches to improving the environment or people’s lives – including, of course, Raspberry Pi’s founding mission to make cheap computers and computing resources readily available to all to support learning.\nWhen Raspberry Pi floated on the London Stock Exchange on 11 June 2024, we were proud to be awarded the LSE’s Green Economy Mark. The Mark recognises that not only are our products efficient in terms of resource usage, they also enable the displacement of other, less sustainable, technologies.\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi joins the London Stock Exchange\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve also worked to reduce the environmental impact of our manufacturing and shipping. Over time we have reduced our use of plastic packaging and shrunk product carton and shipper sizes, as well as working on more efficient production methods such as the new intrusive reflow soldering process for Raspberry Pi 5. The latter both saves energy and reduces the physical manufacturing footprint at the factory, while increasing throughput. As well as benefitting the environment, all of these initiatives improve our products’ cost structure, increasing efficiency and allowing us to keep our prices lower.\nNow that we are a public limited company, we have formalised the role of sustainability within the business, with a Sustainability Committee to oversee activities like these. The committee monitors our performance using various metrics such as CO₂ emissions and materials use, comes up with future targets, and challenges the team to develop a strategy to achieve them. Raspberry Pi aims to be a leader in sustainable practices within the technology sector while maintaining our core focus on providing affordable and accessible technology for all. Below we explore the key principles that guide our sustainability strategy, and look at how we calculate our impact in terms of carbon emissions.\nGuiding principles for sustainable practices\nRaspberry Pi is firmly committed to sustainability alongside our responsibility to our shareholders. Our commitment is driven by the beliefs of our founders, our team, and the Raspberry Pi Foundation, our largest shareholder and a charity focused on digital skills education. Customers quite rightly value credible and meaningful sustainability initiatives, which often have an important positive impact on brand reputation and market share, and we are able to balance these activities with the need to perform in a price-sensitive market. It goes without saying that we will adhere to all UK sustainability laws and regulations transparently, and we will also monitor voluntary best practices and adopt them where we can.  \nAs well as monitoring and reducing our own CO₂ footprint, we are conscious of emissions generated by the many third parties we rely on for supply of materials and services – components, shipping, and so on. Encouraging suppliers to reduce their environmental impact is central to Raspberry Pi’s approach, and we are beginning to engage with all our suppliers, asking them to quantify the carbon content in their products. Over time we will consider the “carbon cost” of what we purchase (broadly, the cost of an equivalent high-quality carbon offset), as well as the base item cost, when we do our costing calculations. So, for example, a diode from one manufacturer may appear cheaper than one from another manufacturer, but if the carbon cost of the first is higher, we would take this into account and might choose the second. Over time this will favour lower-carbon solutions and encourage manufacturers to supply lower-carbon products.\nRaspberry Pi prioritises keeping our products affordable and accessible, empowering customers to make informed choices about offsetting their own carbon footprint. This allows us to maintain profitability and maximise our contribution to the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s charitable mission, which remains a core objective for the company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring emissions\nIt’s imporant that our sustainability efforts are both transparent and accountable. To this end, we are actively measuring our carbon footprint across what are known as Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, and we have developed a methodology to assess our environmental impact as accurately as possible.\nScope 1 and 2 emissions\nScope 1 emissions are the direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by a company, while Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from generating the energy that the company purchases. Scope 2 includes emissions from electricity, heating, and cooling that the company consumes; although the company doesn’t produce these emissions directly, it is still responsible for them because they result from its energy consumption.\nFor Raspberry Pi, Scope 1 and 2 are lumped together, since we don’t have any energy-generating assets that emit carbon. We measure these emissions via the energy bills for our various offices and shops.\nScope 3 emissions\nScope 3 emissions encompass all the other indirect emissions that occur in a company’s value chain. This is the broadest category; it includes emissions from upstream activities like the production and transportation of raw materials, as well as downstream activities like the use and disposal of products. Scope 3 emissions also cover employee commuting, business travel, and waste generated in a company’s operations.\nWe divide the measurement of Scope 3 emissions into two categories: emissions due to products that we make to sell, and other carbon emissions generated through our business activities. As we are a company that sells millions of computers and accessories every year, our product emissions are especially important to understand. \nUnderstanding carbon emissions from Raspberry Pi products\nLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a method for evaluating the environmental impact of a product throughout its life, from sourcing the materials used to make it through to disposing of it. We assess emissions for all our products across all of their LCA phases except for customer usage of the product. The diagram below shows the different phases in a product’s life cycle:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo assess the environmental impact of our products, we worked with our partner Inhabit to conduct a comprehensive study, following the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and ISO 14044:2006 standards. We used industry-leading tools from Inhabit together with the EcoInvent database to calculate the carbon footprint of products throughout their lifecycle. This involved carrying out a detailed analysis of a set of individual, representative products across our range, then applying the results to other, similar products.\nCalculating individual product carbon emissions\nHow do we calculate the carbon emitted when a product is manufactured? In a nutshell, we first take every item in the product’s Bill of Materials (BOM) and find the carbon emitted during its production (called its embodied carbon), and add up all these emissions. We then take account of the carbon used to make the product in the factory as well as the carbon emitted during shipping (both shipping of the materials to make the product, and shipping of the finished product). Finally, we add on a number representing the carbon we expect will be emitted when the product is disposed of.\nThis may sound like a fairly simple step-by-step process, but finding the exact quantity of embodied carbon for every item of a product’s BOM is not easy – in most cases you can’t (yet) just ask a manufacturer what the embodied carbon is in their capacitor or diode or PCB or other widget. So how do we do it? The simple answer is averages: lots of them, in a database.\nWe map every item in a product’s BOM to a category in an officially recognised database which contains the average embedded carbon for many, many categories; there may be a category for the average small signal diode or capacitor, or for the production of steel plate, and so on. Often these figures are provided by mass – a certain quantity of carbon emitted per unit mass of the product – which means we need to know the mass of each component. Where there are no good matches for a particular item, we might need to look at that item’s own BOM, calculating the mass of the various materials in a connector, for example, and using yet more averages for the plastic, metals, and processes involved in order to estimate its embodied carbon.\n\n\n\n\nRaspberry Pi hardware is manufactured at Sony’s facility in Pencoed, south Wales\n\n\n\n\nFor the carbon emitted in factory production, we can use real data provided by our contract manufacturer Sony, and for shipping we also have quite a lot of real data to hand. For product end-of-life, we have to turn to averages once more and add on the average carbon cost of disposal; again, these figures come from an officially recognised database.\nAs I explained above, we do these detailed calculations for a representative subset of our products, and then we scale the carbon footprint calculations proportionally for products with similar designs or varying sizes. We have also categorised certain items which sell in smaller quantities as “de minimis”: for these products, we have estimated their environmental impact by applying to them the average CO₂ emissions per dollar of revenue across our calculated products. This has allowed us to provide a comprehensive carbon footprint assessment for our entire product range.\nLastly, the total emissions per product are combined with our yearly sales number for each product to give us our final estimate of Scope 3 carbon emissions in the product category across our business.\nOther Scope 3 emissions\nI wrote earlier in this article that we divide Scope 3 carbon emissions into two categories: product emissions and other emissions. To calculate emissions for the other Scope 3 items, we take all the non-product transactions for the year from our accounting journals, and assign a category to each one. Then we can link this category to average emissions per pound spent; these average figures are drawn, once more, from the EcoInvent database. This allows us to convert the money we have spent with a business into a carbon emission figure. \nCombining all of our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions gives us a yearly emissions figure. For 2024, this will be reported in our inaugural annual report in April 2025.\nCan we rely on the results? What do we do with them?\nA good question to ask, given that our Scope 3 emissions calculations are based on a large sum of approximations, is how accurate – and therefore how useful – all this is. We’re using approved standards for these processes, and other businesses like ours will necessarily be calculating their emissions in a similar way; the averages method is the best currently available. It’s important to bear in mind that the results are an approximation, and this is a reason to work towards better data in the future, not a reason to be discouraged.\n\n\n\n\nEach Raspberry Pi Carbon Removal Credit offsets the embodied carbon of a Raspberry Pi computer\n\n\n\n\nAs well as carbon emitted today, our monitoring work allows us to get a stake in the ground and the infrastructure in place to measure carbon emitted in the future, steadily improving our accuracy over time.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Raspberry Pi’s official magazine, The MagPi, has turned the big 150 and decided to mark the occasion in true maker style with a special feature celebrating 150 Raspberry Pi people and projects previously featured on its hallowed pages. Here, we’ve cherry-picked a few of our favourites. You can read the full feature, including Raspberry Pi appearances on TV, some famous makers, and excellent Pi-focused events, in The MagPi #150. \n\n\n\n\nWe Still Fax\n\nPeople found creative ways to stay entertained in 2020. Enter We Still Fax, an intriguing theatrical project that interacts with an audience remotely using a fax machine. The core components of the show are the fax machine, Raspberry Pi, and Grandstream adapter, which translates a phone signal into an Ethernet signal and vice versa.\n› From issue #102\nBluebot shoal fish robots\n\nThe Blueswarm team from Harvard University set out to explore how shoals of fish coordinate by building a swarm of underwater fish robots. Raspberry Pi Zero W was used to create multiple Bluebot fish-style robots that can be accessed remotely.\n› From issue #107\nDoom on a LEGO brick\n\nTaking gaming on a tiny screen to its extreme, maker James Brown responded to enquiries about whether his LEGO brick-embedded console could play the popular first-person shooter. With a 0.42-inch OLED, 4MB flash chip, and RP2040 microcontroller (as on Pico), it uses the latter’s second core to update the screen fast enough to create greyscale images and play video.\n› From issue #129\nBrewPi\n\nBrewPi was one of the first initiatives to recognise the power of Raspberry Pi for precision brewing. The BrewPi Spark 3 is a temperature controller that handles beer or wine fermentation with 0.1°C precision and sends data to an on‑board display.\n› brewpi.com\nTeasmade 2.0\n\nMartin Spendiff and Vanessa Bradley updated a Goblin Teasmade with a Raspberry Pi Zero WH to produce their hot drink of choice… coffee! It uses a Grove ReSpeaker HAT and a speaker with a relay switch to replace the alarm. A script monitors Google Calendar, and if it sees a trigger phrase, it starts the boil cycle.\n› From issue #114\nNOUS: Undersea vision surveillance system\n\nGreece’s NTAU School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering knew plenty about Raspberry Pi before selecting it for its underwater archaeology surveillance project, in which a self-powered submarine unit detects people or craft coming close to sensitive marine areas and sites of historic wrecks and alerts authorities to potential intruders.\n› From issue #117\nSmart Buoy\n\n\n\n\n\nA solar-powered sensor buoy that is “cheap to build, easy to run”, and provides continuous and reliable data. It helps study rising sea levels and was deployed in Grenada in the Caribbean for this job. It communicates via radio signals to a Raspberry Pi base station — something Raspberry Pi is very well suited to.\n› From issue #106 \nScreenDress\n\nArt and technology can go hand-in-hand, especially with this Raspberry Pi Zero W-powered dress that shows how the wearer is feeling via the special EEG headband they wear and the images displayed on various (eye-catching) screens attached to the outfit.\n› From issue #135\nThe MagPi #150 out NOW!\nYou can grab the new issue right now from Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, WHSmith, and other newsagents, including the Raspberry Pi Store in Cambridge. It’s also available at our online store, which ships around the world. You can also get it via our app on Android or iOS.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also subscribe to the print version of The MagPi.

MixPilot gets mounted to concrete delivery trucks and, through the use of sensors and algorithms, can monitor various aspects of concrete being delivered, including a property known as its slump. This is done to ensure the quality of the concrete and give the fleet operators more visibility into the trucks and their payload, as well as bringing other new operational benefits. Part of their product’s charm is that it’s easy to install on the truck: it&#8217;s “set and forget”, meaning it doesn’t require much maintenance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slump is a measurement of how well concrete flows when it’s poured.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Lately, well-crafted connected devices with wireless sensors and reliable, low-cost compute hardware have been revolutionising many “unconnected” industries, services, and applications. One such industry and service is the delivery of pre-mixed concrete.\nImage from giatecscientific.com\nA Canadian customer of ours called Giatec recently launched a unique and very clever product called MixPilot. MixPilot gets mounted to concrete delivery trucks and, through the use of sensors and algorithms, can monitor various aspects of concrete being delivered, including a property known as its slump. This is done to ensure the quality of the concrete and give the fleet operators more visibility into the trucks and their payload, as well as bringing other new operational benefits. Part of their product’s charm is that it’s easy to install on the truck: it’s “set and forget”, meaning it doesn’t require much maintenance.\nSlump is a measurement of how well concrete flows when it’s poured. It is important for the slump to be in the right range when the concrete is poured into a form or mould, as otherwise it might not flow correctly to fill the volume, leaving voids. Bad news if you want a structurally sound construction.\nTo deliver MixPilot, Giatec built a highly reliable wireless gateway based on our Compute Module 4 and paired it with two custom sensors that wirelessly send their sensor readings back to the gateway, where the data is processed and the concrete payload’s status is displayed to the truck operator. The gateway is then connected to Giatec’s cloud via cellular, allowing for further data processing as well as providing the end customer with a cloud console to enable useful features, such as alerts and fleet-wide stats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur line of Compute Modules is ideal for this type of “edge compute” application for lots of reasons:\nLow power: allows great levels of compute without needing to worry about heat\nFlexible: Giatec engineered a custom Compute Module 4 carrier board that has all the interface hardware and cellular radios needed to enable their product\nGreat Raspberry Pi software: Giatec’s talented engineers were able to develop and release the product very quickly, in part thanks to our robust Raspberry Pi OS\nSecure: Compute Module 4 has the ability to run secure software and supports secure boot, which is provisioned by our handy tools on the customer’s production line\nPre-certified wireless: CM4 optionally includes dual-band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, so you can effortlessly enable wireless comms without a costly development or certification process\nCost-optimised: CM4 is great value and has 32 SKUs to choose from, so you can scale up or down the RAM, storage, and wireless options to best suit your application\nLong lifetime: Giatec and other customers can rely on CM4 to be available from Raspberry Pi until at least January 2034\nLearn more about MixPilot on Giatec’s website.\nThe post Clever concrete compute appeared first on Raspberry Pi.",
