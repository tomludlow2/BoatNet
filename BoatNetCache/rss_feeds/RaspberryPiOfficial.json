Richard is also one of several experienced cave explorers involved in mapping the subterranean network of cenotes [sinkholes] in Yucatan, Mexico. “The caves are stunningly beautiful and [mapping them] is technically difficult,” he says. “A lot of effort goes into staying alive.” Acoustic and magnetic mapping can help plot the location and direction of these unexplored passageways, improving safety for all who visit them — an endeavour made more robust using Raspberry Shake, a Raspberry Pi-based device more commonly used to detect earthquakes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"710\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/compass-line-measure-1024x710.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114997\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/compass-line-measure-1024x710.png 1024w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/compass-line-measure-300x208.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/compass-line-measure-768x532.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/compass-line-measure-1536x1065.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/compass-line-measure-800x555.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/compass-line-measure-450x312.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/compass-line-measure-900x624.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/compass-line-measure-216x150.png 216w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/compass-line-measure.png 1888w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Cave measurements are made manually underwater using a compass and tape&nbsp;measure</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The maps are also useful for dive guides keen to show off the speleothems (mineral deposits such as stalactites and stalagmites), and for developers to know whether building on a particular area is possible and permissible.

We especially liked this one, which shows you how to take control of your home, and your privacy, with a Raspberry Pi 4.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Home automation is not only useful but can also be a great deal of fun, particularly when setting up cool automations or connecting different devices together in new ways. It can also help boost the energy efficiency and security of your home; there are a wealth of practical reasons to start experimenting with this technology. Although there are different vendor-specific automation systems out there, we prefer one that doesn’t ‘lock’ you into one provider. One such platform is Home Assistant (<a href=\"http://home-assistant.io\">home-assistant.io</a>), a free open-source operating system designed with flexibility and independence in mind. Home Assistant is a huge topic, but here we’ll look at the basics of setting up a server to get you started on your automation journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"872\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/pg141-1-1024x872.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114958\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/pg141-1-1024x872.jpg 1024w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/pg141-1-300x255.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/pg141-1-768x654.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/pg141-1-800x681.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/pg141-1-450x383.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/pg141-1-900x766.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/pg141-1.jpg 1407w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Prepare your Raspberry Pi</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Home Assistant isn’t strictly an operating system in its own right, it is available as a Raspberry Pi image that significantly reduces the work a user has to do to get up and running. Home Assistant is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi as the sole service. It is possible to run Home Assistant alongside other apps and services, but we’re keeping to the true path here. Home Assistant works with Raspberry Pi 3, but we strongly recommend using a Raspberry Pi 4 for the best performance. You should also use a wired Ethernet connection for setup and to ensure reliability. Home Assistant is headless, so no monitor or keyboard is needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"571\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/complex-Medium.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114968\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/complex-Medium.jpeg 640w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/complex-Medium-300x268.jpeg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/complex-Medium-450x401.jpeg 450w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">As your confidence and knowledge grow, you can create more complex dashboards.

In Imager, select Choose OS &gt;&nbsp;Other specific-purpose OS &gt; Home assistants and home automation &gt; Home Assistant &gt; Home Assistant OS 9.5 (RPI 4/400 or RPI 3, as needed).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll now get a ready-to-boot image. Insert&nbsp;the card&nbsp;into your Raspberry Pi, make sure you’ve&nbsp;got a wired network connection, and power&nbsp;up. After a few minutes, try to connect to <strong>http://homeassistant:8123</strong> in your web browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"780\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/pg142-2-780x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114955\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/pg142-2-780x1024.jpg 780w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/pg142-2-228x300.jpg 228w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/pg142-2-768x1008.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/pg142-2-800x1050.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/pg142-2-450x591.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/pg142-2.jpg 805w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Replace your porch light with a smart light bulb and you can trigger it at sundown all year round</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Initial setup</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Time to grab your favourite beverage. You’ll see an initial setup screen stating that it will take about 20 minutes before you can proceed. Soon it will be automatically replaced with the first stage of setup. Provide your name, username, and choice of password. On the next screen, there will be some questions about the server’s location. It’s important to set this accurately if you want to take advantage of sun-up/down times. Finally, Home Assistant will ‘look’ around your network for any existing smart devices and let you know what it’s found. Don’t&nbsp;worry if something doesn’t appear, it will probably just need manual configuration later on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Add integrations</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Home Assistant refers to smart platforms as ‘integrations’. For instance, if you have Philips Hue or IKEA Trådfri smart lights, it will add an integration for them and then a ‘device’ for each light it finds. It will also create a default dashboard for you based on what’s been found.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "For 2025’s Official Raspberry Pi Handbook, PJ Evans created an entire feature exploring the world of Raspberry Pi home automation projects. We especially liked this one, which shows you how to take control of your home, and your privacy, with a Raspberry Pi 4.\nHome automation is not only useful but can also be a great deal of fun, particularly when setting up cool automations or connecting different devices together in new ways. It can also help boost the energy efficiency and security of your home; there are a wealth of practical reasons to start experimenting with this technology. Although there are different vendor-specific automation systems out there, we prefer one that doesn’t ‘lock’ you into one provider. One such platform is Home Assistant (home-assistant.io), a free open-source operating system designed with flexibility and independence in mind. Home Assistant is a huge topic, but here we’ll look at the basics of setting up a server to get you started on your automation journey.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepare your Raspberry Pi\nAlthough Home Assistant isn’t strictly an operating system in its own right, it is available as a Raspberry Pi image that significantly reduces the work a user has to do to get up and running. Home Assistant is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi as the sole service. It is possible to run Home Assistant alongside other apps and services, but we’re keeping to the true path here. Home Assistant works with Raspberry Pi 3, but we strongly recommend using a Raspberry Pi 4 for the best performance. You should also use a wired Ethernet connection for setup and to ensure reliability. Home Assistant is headless, so no monitor or keyboard is needed.\n\n\n\n\nAs your confidence and knowledge grow, you can create more complex dashboards. You can even incorporate video feed\nWrite the Home Assistant image\nLuckily for us, you can write the latest stable Home Assistant image directly from the Raspberry Pi Imager. Insert a fast SD card 32GB or more in size into your computer. In Imager, select Choose OS > Other specific-purpose OS > Home assistants and home automation > Home Assistant > Home Assistant OS 9.5 (RPI 4/400 or RPI 3, as needed).\nYou’ll now get a ready-to-boot image. Insert the card into your Raspberry Pi, make sure you’ve got a wired network connection, and power up. After a few minutes, try to connect to http://homeassistant:8123 in your web browser.\n\n\n\n\nReplace your porch light with a smart light bulb and you can trigger it at sundown all year round\nInitial setup\nTime to grab your favourite beverage. You’ll see an initial setup screen stating that it will take about 20 minutes before you can proceed. Soon it will be automatically replaced with the first stage of setup. Provide your name, username, and choice of password. On the next screen, there will be some questions about the server’s location. It’s important to set this accurately if you want to take advantage of sun-up/down times. Finally, Home Assistant will ‘look’ around your network for any existing smart devices and let you know what it’s found. Don’t worry if something doesn’t appear, it will probably just need manual configuration later on.\nAdd integrations\nHome Assistant refers to smart platforms as ‘integrations’. For instance, if you have Philips Hue or IKEA Trådfri smart lights, it will add an integration for them and then a ‘device’ for each light it finds. It will also create a default dashboard for you based on what’s been found. Not all integrations can be found automatically, so you can browse available integrations and add them yourself or install third-party add-ons. Integrations include lights, security devices, media centres, printers, and mains power controllers —you can even make your own. At this point, it’s best to start exploring.\n\n\n\n\nCombine devices to create clever energy-saving automation. Got solar panels? When it’s sunny, switch the washing machine and all the lights on\nCustomisation\nOne of Home Assistant’s greatest strengths is customisation. The dashboard system (‘Lovelace’) allows you to arrange your device control and set automations however you like them. By default, Home Assistant automates the layout, but we recommend you disable that. Click the three dots in the top right of the screen, followed by ‘Edit dashboard’. You’ll be asked if you want to take control of layout. Do so, and then you can create your perfect layout. You can resize, restyle, add graphs, tabs, and badges. Don’t be intimidated; start small and build things up as you become more familiar.\nNext steps\nCongratulations, you now have a running Home Assistant server. The capabilities of this service can seem overwhelming at times, but with a little reading on home-assistant.io and some digging around the menus, you’ll soon be taking control of your home. Once you’ve added the ability to switch devices on and off, or monitor things like printer ink levels, move on to Automations. These allow certain actions to happen based on events. For example, you can have a motion sensor turn on certain lights around the house.

Miloš also wanted the device to use a well-supported microcontroller unit with wireless capabilities, hence the use of a Raspberry Pi Pico W. “It provided everything I needed in a small package and was supported by a large community, which meant everything would be easy to troubleshoot,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"461\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption1-1024x461.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114898\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption1-1024x461.jpg 1024w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption1-300x135.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption1-768x346.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption1-1536x691.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption1-2048x922.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption1-800x360.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption1-450x203.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption1-900x405.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The main device casing as well as the PPG clamp have been 3D printed using a Creality K1C. The models can be downloaded from&nbsp;Printables</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Along the way, Miloš began to add more features, including a stethoscope and the ability to take an ECG measurement. By using a photoplethysmography (PPG) clamp, he also figured the device could detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue and that, combined, these sensors would be able to give a better insight into a person’s heart health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet he was clear from the start that he wasn’t going to create a medical device. Instead, the ultimate aim was to take readings and conduct experiments to discover an optimal algorithm for measuring blood pressure. “The whole area of blood pressure monitors was a curiosity for me and I wanted to demystify it a bit and generally have a platform which other people can experiment with,” he explains. “So I created a setup that can be used for experimenting with new methods of analysing cardiography signals.”</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption4-1024x695.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114902\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption4-1024x695.jpg 1024w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption4-300x204.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption4-768x521.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption4-1536x1042.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption4-2048x1390.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption4-800x543.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption4-450x305.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption4-900x611.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">To connect the stethoscope to the system, the earphones were removed and a small piezo microphone was then connected to an amplifier circuit</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Heart of the build</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To fulfil his ambition, he got to work designing the PCB before looking at the other necessary components, such as the pump, valve, battery, and connectors. Some parts were simple enough — for example, the air pressure cuff, which you’ve likely seen on a visit to a GP or hospital. “This is the only sensor most commercial devices use, and the estimations using it are good enough for most cases,” Miloš says. But others required more work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ECG sensor to record heart activity was an important part of the build. “I wanted to extract the pulses from the air pressure signal and for the ECG to be my reference measurement so that I knew the algorithm was working properly,” he says. For this, Miloš included a custom layout of the AD8232 IC on the PCB (AD8232 is an integrated signal conditioning block for ECG measurement applications), allowing measurements to be taken.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"651\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption2-1024x651.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114899\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption2-1024x651.jpg 1024w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption2-300x191.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption2-768x488.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption2-1536x976.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption2-2048x1301.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption2-800x508.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption2-450x286.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/02/Open-Cardiography-Signal-Measuring-Device-caption2-900x572.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The pressure sensor calibration apparatus was created so that constant pressure can be maintained in the system</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Miloš also made a PPG clamp using a MikroE Oxi5 Click board that communicated with the rest of the system over I2C. “The PPG clamp is often used to measure blood oxygen saturation, but since it works by detecting the changes in blood flow in the finger, it’s a very useful sensor when it’s used in combination with the arm cuff,” Miloš says. “Since the arm cuff cuts off circulation in the arm, and then slowly lowers the air pressure inside until the circulation is established again, by using the PPG we can have a precise detection of when the laminar flow has been established again, which is the moment that the air pressure inside the arm cuff is equal to the diastolic air pressure.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, an old analogue stethoscope was added. Miloš combined this with a small piezo microphone, turning the stethoscope into an electronic device. “A stethoscope is used when doing manual blood pressure measurements, and since [this] is still the gold standard for non-invasive methods, I wanted to see how the signal on the stethoscope looks during this process and if I could draw any conclusions from it,” Miloš&nbsp;reveals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pressure’s on</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To make sense of the data, Miloš decided the project would need a graphical interface. “This would have a live view of all of the measured signals and the capability of recording all of the data into a CSV file,” he says.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Having looked to see how blood pressure monitors operate, Miloš Rašić has been hard at work trying to improve their accuracy. David Crookes conducted this interview for the special 150th anniversary issue of our official magazine. \nKeeping track of blood pressure is crucial for maintaining good health, especially when managing heart-related conditions. Electrical engineer Miloš Rašić knows this only too well. “Like most older people, my grandma suffers from elevated blood pressure, so a digital pressure monitor is something that is being used daily in the household,” he says. But he also noticed the machines can be flawed.\n\n\n\n\nBesides the main PCB, which is based around a Raspberry Pi Pico W, there is an air pump and valve, GX12 connectors, buttons, an 18650 battery, NeoPixel LEDs, an OLED display, and some other smaller parts\n“Different monitors have provided widely different measurements and their performance was highly dependent on their battery level, which is not a good thing,” he explains. “So for my master’s thesis project, I wanted to explore digital blood pressure monitors and discover how they work.” This led him to develop a cardiography signal measuring device based around a Raspberry Pi Pico W.\nConducting experiments\nWhen Miloš approached his project, he had a list of requirements in mind, chief among them being safety. “The device had to have optical isolation when connected to a PC and be battery-powered or have an isolated power supply,” he says. \nAs a priority, it needed to measure blood pressure. “This included measuring the air pressure inside an arm cuff, controlling a small air pump, and controlling an electromagnetic valve,” he adds. Miloš also wanted the device to use a well-supported microcontroller unit with wireless capabilities, hence the use of a Raspberry Pi Pico W. “It provided everything I needed in a small package and was supported by a large community, which meant everything would be easy to troubleshoot,” he says.\n\n\n\n\nThe main device casing as well as the PPG clamp have been 3D printed using a Creality K1C. The models can be downloaded from Printables\nAlong the way, Miloš began to add more features, including a stethoscope and the ability to take an ECG measurement. By using a photoplethysmography (PPG) clamp, he also figured the device could detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue and that, combined, these sensors would be able to give a better insight into a person’s heart health.\nAnd yet he was clear from the start that he wasn’t going to create a medical device. Instead, the ultimate aim was to take readings and conduct experiments to discover an optimal algorithm for measuring blood pressure. “The whole area of blood pressure monitors was a curiosity for me and I wanted to demystify it a bit and generally have a platform which other people can experiment with,” he explains. “So I created a setup that can be used for experimenting with new methods of analysing cardiography signals.”\n\n\n\n\nTo connect the stethoscope to the system, the earphones were removed and a small piezo microphone was then connected to an amplifier circuit\n\n\n\n\nHeart of the build\nTo fulfil his ambition, he got to work designing the PCB before looking at the other necessary components, such as the pump, valve, battery, and connectors. Some parts were simple enough — for example, the air pressure cuff, which you’ve likely seen on a visit to a GP or hospital. “This is the only sensor most commercial devices use, and the estimations using it are good enough for most cases,” Miloš says. But others required more work.\nThe ECG sensor to record heart activity was an important part of the build. “I wanted to extract the pulses from the air pressure signal and for the ECG to be my reference measurement so that I knew the algorithm was working properly,” he says. For this, Miloš included a custom layout of the AD8232 IC on the PCB (AD8232 is an integrated signal conditioning block for ECG measurement applications), allowing measurements to be taken.\n\n\n\n\nThe pressure sensor calibration apparatus was created so that constant pressure can be maintained in the system\nMiloš also made a PPG clamp using a MikroE Oxi5 Click board that communicated with the rest of the system over I2C. “The PPG clamp is often used to measure blood oxygen saturation, but since it works by detecting the changes in blood flow in the finger, it’s a very useful sensor when it’s used in combination with the arm cuff,” Miloš says. “Since the arm cuff cuts off circulation in the arm, and then slowly lowers the air pressure inside until the circulation is established again, by using the PPG we can have a precise detection of when the laminar flow has been established again, which is the moment that the air pressure inside the arm cuff is equal to the diastolic air pressure.”\nFinally, an old analogue stethoscope was added. Miloš combined this with a small piezo microphone, turning the stethoscope into an electronic device. “A stethoscope is used when doing manual blood pressure measurements, and since [this] is still the gold standard for non-invasive methods, I wanted to see how the signal on the stethoscope looks during this process and if I could draw any conclusions from it,” Miloš reveals.\nPressure’s on\nTo make sense of the data, Miloš decided the project would need a graphical interface. “This would have a live view of all of the measured signals and the capability of recording all of the data into a CSV file,” he says. It required a hefty dose of programming; Python was used to code the GUI, handling the graphical interface, the communication with the device, and the data logging capabilities. Python was also used to analyse the recorded signals, while the firmware was written in C++, “so that it runs as fast as possible on the Pico,” Miloš explains. \n\n\n\n\nA custom four-layer PCB was developed, using Raspberry Pi Pico W as the microcontroller\nWith everything working, Miloš designed a case. “I needed to see the rough space required for everything, which allowed me to design a case with mounting points for each of those things,” he says. “On the top, there is a lid that has NeoPixel LEDs and a small OLED display that can be programmed to show information to the user.”\nSince then, he’s been using the project to conduct many tests, and you can see the results of those on Miloš’ GitHub page.

Over time we have reduced our use of plastic packaging and shrunk product carton and shipper sizes, as well as working on more efficient production methods such as the new intrusive reflow soldering process for Raspberry Pi 5. The latter both saves energy and reduces the physical manufacturing footprint at the factory, while increasing throughput. As well as benefitting the environment, all of these initiatives improve our products&#8217; cost structure, increasing efficiency and allowing us to keep our prices lower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we are a public limited company, we have formalised the role of sustainability within the business, with a Sustainability Committee to oversee activities like these. The committee monitors our performance using various metrics such as CO₂ emissions and materials use, comes up with future targets, and challenges the team to develop a strategy to achieve them. Raspberry Pi aims to be a leader in sustainable practices within the technology sector while maintaining our core focus on providing affordable and accessible technology for all. Below we explore the key principles that guide our sustainability strategy, and look at how we calculate our impact in terms of carbon emissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Guiding principles for sustainable practices</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Raspberry Pi is firmly committed to sustainability alongside our responsibility to our shareholders. Our commitment is driven by the beliefs of our founders, our team, and the Raspberry Pi Foundation, our largest shareholder and a charity focused on digital skills education. Customers quite rightly value credible and meaningful sustainability initiatives, which often have an important positive impact on brand reputation and market share, and we are able to balance these activities with the need to perform in a price-sensitive market. It goes without saying that we will adhere to all UK sustainability laws and regulations transparently, and we will also monitor voluntary best practices and adopt them where we can.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as monitoring and reducing our own CO₂ footprint, we are conscious of emissions generated by the many third parties we rely on for supply of materials and services – components, shipping, and so on. Encouraging suppliers to reduce their environmental impact is central to Raspberry Pi&#8217;s approach, and we are beginning to engage with all our suppliers, asking them to quantify the carbon content in their products. Over time we will consider the &#8220;carbon cost&#8221; of what we purchase (broadly, the cost of an equivalent high-quality carbon offset), as well as the base item cost, when we do our costing calculations. So, for example, a diode from one manufacturer may appear cheaper than one from another manufacturer, but if the carbon cost of the first is higher, we would take this into account and might choose the second. Over time this will favour lower-carbon solutions and encourage manufacturers to supply lower-carbon products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Raspberry Pi prioritises keeping our products affordable and accessible, empowering customers to make informed choices about offsetting their own carbon footprint. This allows us to maintain profitability and maximise our contribution to the Raspberry Pi Foundation&#8217;s charitable mission, which remains a core objective for the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"A tale of two Raspberry Pis\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EoSPR_dZnYg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Measuring emissions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s imporant that our sustainability efforts are both transparent and accountable. To this end, we are actively measuring our carbon footprint across what are known as Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, and we have developed a methodology to assess our environmental impact as accurately as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scope 1 and 2 emissions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scope 1 </strong>emissions are the direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by a company, while <strong>Scope 2 </strong>emissions are indirect emissions from generating the energy that the company purchases. Scope 2 includes emissions from electricity, heating, and cooling that the company consumes; although the company doesn&#8217;t produce these emissions directly, it is still responsible for them because they result from its energy consumption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Raspberry Pi, Scope 1 and 2 are lumped together, since we don’t have any energy-generating assets that emit carbon. We measure these emissions via the energy bills for our various offices and shops.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scope 3 emissions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scope 3 emissions</strong> encompass all the other indirect emissions that occur in a company&#8217;s value chain. This is the broadest category; it includes emissions from upstream activities like the production and transportation of raw materials, as well as downstream activities like the use and disposal of products. Scope 3 emissions also cover employee commuting, business travel, and waste generated in a company&#8217;s operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We divide the measurement of Scope 3 emissions into two categories: emissions due to <em>products </em>that we make to sell, and <em>other </em>carbon emissions generated through our business activities. As we are a company that sells millions of computers and accessories every year, our product emissions are especially important to understand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding carbon emissions from Raspberry Pi products</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a method for evaluating the environmental impact of a product throughout its life, from sourcing the materials used to make it through to disposing of it. We assess emissions for all our products across all of their LCA phases except for customer usage of the product. The diagram below shows the different phases in a product&#8217;s life cycle:</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Picture1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114515\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Picture1.png 940w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Picture1-300x38.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Picture1-768x98.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Picture1-800x102.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Picture1-450x57.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Picture1-900x115.png 900w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To assess the environmental impact of our products, we worked with our partner <a href=\"https://inhabit.eco/\">Inhabit</a> to conduct a comprehensive study, following the <a href=\"https://ghgprotocol.org/\">Greenhouse Gas Protocol</a> and <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/38498.html\">ISO 14044:2006</a> standards. We used industry-leading tools from Inhabit together with the <a href=\"https://ecoinvent.org/\">EcoInvent</a> database to calculate the carbon footprint of products throughout their lifecycle. This involved carrying out a detailed analysis of a set of individual, representative products across our range, then applying the results to other, similar products.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Calculating individual product carbon emissions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>How do we calculate the carbon emitted when a product is manufactured? In a nutshell, we first take every item in the product’s Bill of Materials (BOM) and find the carbon emitted during its production (called its embodied carbon), and add up all these emissions. We then take account of the carbon used to make the product in the factory as well as the carbon emitted during shipping (both shipping of the materials to make the product, and shipping of the finished product). Finally, we add on a number representing the carbon we expect will be emitted when the product is disposed of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may sound like a fairly simple step-by-step process, but finding the exact quantity of embodied carbon for every item of a product&#8217;s BOM is not easy – in most cases you can’t (yet) just ask a manufacturer what the embodied carbon is in their capacitor or diode or PCB or other widget. So how do we do it? The simple answer is averages: lots of them, in a database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We map every item in a product&#8217;s BOM to a category in an officially recognised database which contains the average embedded carbon for many, many categories; there may be a category for the average small signal diode or capacitor, or for the production of steel plate, and so on. Often these figures are provided by mass – a certain quantity of carbon emitted per unit mass of the product – which means we need to know the mass of each component. Where there are no good matches for a particular item, we might need to look at that item&#8217;s own BOM, calculating the mass of the various materials in a connector, for example, and using yet more averages for the plastic, metals, and processes involved in order to estimate its embodied carbon.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/03/SONY_FACTORY_2020__015-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-107044\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/03/SONY_FACTORY_2020__015-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/03/SONY_FACTORY_2020__015-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/03/SONY_FACTORY_2020__015-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/03/SONY_FACTORY_2020__015-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/03/SONY_FACTORY_2020__015-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/03/SONY_FACTORY_2020__015-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/03/SONY_FACTORY_2020__015-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2024/03/SONY_FACTORY_2020__015-900x600.jpg 900w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Raspberry Pi hardware is manufactured at Sony&#8217;s facility in Pencoed, south Wales</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For the carbon emitted in factory production, we can use real data provided by our contract manufacturer Sony, and for shipping we also have quite a lot of real data to hand.

We have also categorised certain items which sell in smaller quantities as &#8220;de minimis&#8221;: for these products, we have estimated their environmental impact by applying to them the average CO₂ emissions per dollar of revenue across our calculated products. This has allowed us to provide a comprehensive carbon footprint assessment for our entire product range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, the total emissions per product are combined with our yearly sales number for each product to give us our final estimate of Scope 3 carbon emissions in the <em>product</em> category across our business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other Scope 3 emissions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote earlier in this article that we divide Scope 3 carbon emissions into two categories: <em>product</em> emissions and <em>other</em> emissions.

What do we do with them?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A good question to ask, given that our Scope 3 emissions calculations are based on a large sum of approximations, is how accurate – and therefore how useful – all this is. We&#8217;re using approved standards for these processes, and other businesses like ours will necessarily be calculating their emissions in a similar way; the averages method is the best currently available. It&#8217;s important to bear in mind that the results are an approximation, and this is a reason to work towards better data in the future, not a reason to be discouraged.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Carbon-credits-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-114173\" srcset=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Carbon-credits-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Carbon-credits-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Carbon-credits-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Carbon-credits-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Carbon-credits-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Carbon-credits-450x337.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Carbon-credits-900x675.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.com/app/uploads/2025/01/Carbon-credits.jpg 1890w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Each Raspberry Pi Carbon Removal Credit offsets the embodied carbon of a Raspberry Pi computer</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as carbon emitted today, our monitoring work allows us to get a stake in the ground and the infrastructure in place to measure carbon emitted in the future, steadily improving our accuracy over time.

We are taking our first steps in a long and important journey: in future articles here, we’ll delve deeper into the various initiatives we are undertaking to minimise our environmental impact and build a more sustainable future for computing. Stay tuned to learn more about our efforts in responsible sourcing, energy efficiency, and waste reduction, and find out how you can contribute to a greener Raspberry Pi ecosystem.\nThe post Sustainable solutions with Raspberry Pi appeared first on Raspberry Pi.",
