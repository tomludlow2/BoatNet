    "content:encoded": "<p>For a long time, sailing résumés were not required for anything other than working on boats or joining race crews. Recently, however, I’ve heard a fair amount of talk about sailing résumés becoming more prevalent, particularly that charter companies and insurance companies have wanted to see a summary of a client’s experience. Fortunately, this is not nearly as onerous as it sounds.</p><p>In both cases, summarizing your sailing experience is the primary objective. For insurance companies, much will depend on the kind and size of boat you’re trying to insure and where you intend to sail. </p><p>“Seeking a sailboat insurance policy isn’t that difficult,” GEICO’s Marine Insurance public relations office told me. “However, many boat insurance companies today want to see increasing levels of experience when it comes to insuring a large vessel. If you are trying to insure a large vessel as your very first boat, it’s possible that an insurance company will not want to underwrite that risk…GEICO does not require a customer to submit a formal sailing résumé—but they do want to see a progression of ever-larger vessel operation (when looking for insurance on a large sailboat, for example). GEICO does not have firm guidelines as boaters’ experience can vary, and they look at each application individually.”</p><p>GEICO’s advice to “start small; build your way up” is borne out by anecdotes across the sailing world. For example, a long-time marine surveyor from Massachusetts told me that, “There is a trend toward requiring more experience from the operators, or the use of a qualified captain during the early stage of [an insurance] policy. Usually, the insurers want experience in similar type and size vessels.”</p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjEyMTM2NTQ0NzIxNDQ2NDM1/01-navigating-on-paper-charts-baja.jpg\" height=\"749\" width=\"1200\">\n                        <figcaption>Demonstating expertise in navigation can go a long way.&nbsp;<p>Photo courtesy of Ellen Massey</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>Chartering is another area where summaries of experience are increasingly common. The Moorings has prospective sailors complete a short sailing résumé to help identify the destinations and yacht types and sizes that best fit their experience. Sunsail, Desolation Sound Yacht Charters, Horizon Yacht Charters, and many other companies are similar, all requiring a short summary of experience. Almost all charter companies provide a form you can fill out with this information. </p><p>This is mostly to provide you with the most enjoyable and safest experience; you probably won’t have much fun on your charter if the boat or the destination is beyond your current abilities. If all your experience is in dinghies, for example, bareboat chartering a 50-foot cat on your first charter might not be possible or prudent. However, The Moorings—like most companies—tries to help as much as possible, offering skippered charters or providing a skipper for the first day or so to familiarize less experienced sailors with their chartered boats.</p><p>While charter companies’ forms make the sailing résumé easy to fill out, it’s probably a good idea to go ahead and craft your own ahead of time. It can come in handy if you’re hoping to join a private boat as crew on a longer journey, for instance (paid or unpaid), since the skipper and owner will want to know as much as possible about your experience. Insurers are also unlikely to have a prefab template for you to fill out. So, keeping track of your experience and putting it together into an easily comprehensible résumé that you can continuously edit and present right away when asked is a wise bit of prep work.</p><p>I can think of essentially two approaches to a sailing résumé, and one is not necessarily better than the other. Those who hold U.S. Coast Guard master’s licenses, or who are working towards one, will present their experience in days. For the purposes of the USCG, a “day” is considered eight hours “in an assigned position in either the deck or engineering department of a vessel.” This is certainly the most comprehensive and measurable way to document one’s sea time and will give your résumé reader a very clear idea of your experience.</p><p>But most of us probably aren’t working toward a license that demands this much detail, so another approach is to focus on nautical miles sailed. For most recreational sailors this probably makes the most sense, especially if you are putting together a résumé for the first time after many years of voyaging. </p><p>Regardless of whether you write that you have 2,500 days on the water or have sailed 100,000 nautical miles, the important thing is to present your experience clearly. Your reader will want to know how much experience you have in the type of boat you will be operating, and in the waters where you’ll be sailing. So you’ll want to break down your experience into categories, or particular vessels if most of your experience is aboard just a few boats. Categories would consist of dinghies, small vessels, larger vessels (whether you express this by tonnage or length), catamarans, monohulls, power vessels, and sailing vessels. </p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjEyMTM2NTQ0NzIxNjQzNDk2/02-the-author-dressed-for-the-arctic.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"934\">\n                        <figcaption>The author dressed for the weather in the Arctic. No matter where you sail, logging miles, dates, and boat type helps you write a sailing CV.<p>Photo courtesy of Ellen Massey</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>It’s also a good idea to break down your sea time by type of experience and locations. For example, I present my experience sailing my former 34-foot ketch up the Eastern Seaboard separately from my experience crossing the Pacific aboard my current 40-foot sloop. Even though they are similar vessels, one voyage was coastal sailing and the other involved extensive bluewater passages.</p><p>Finally, it’s also helpful to break down your experience by your role on board: skipper, crew, watch captain, navigator, etc. And it’s a good idea to present recent experience—how many days or miles you’ve sailed in the last few months, the last year, and the last five years.</p><p>As to the form your résumé takes, the most important consideration is to make sure it’s easily understood. For some sailors this may take the form of a spreadsheet-type log, showing days (or miles) as captain, crew, etc.; days/miles in various types of vessels or individual boats; days/miles offshore versus coastal; days/miles in various locations or at various times of year; and days/miles in the most recent time periods. This method is similar to how aircraft pilots break down their experience and will make the most sense for those who have been logging their time consistently for a USCG license.</p><p>But, if you’re putting together a résumé for the first time after years of experience, it may make more sense to construct it much like a conventional job résumé, in reverse chronological order and highlighting the most relevant experience. My own sailing CV follows this “conventional résumé” approach; over the decades I’ve been sailing, I have not kept close track of each day I’ve spent at sea, but I do have a very accurate picture of the ocean miles I’ve sailed.</p><p>I begin my sailing CV with a bullet-point summary. Certain things should be included in this list, especially certifications and boating safety courses. These are important to insurers and charter companies. In fact, it’s impossible to skipper a charter yacht in some Mediterranean countries without certain certifications—RYA Skipper, ICC (International Certificate of Competence), US Sailing Basic Keelboat, etc. </p><p>In my own bullet-point summary, my total sea miles head the list and are followed by my major voyages, my sailing awards, and some statistics like number of ocean crossings and number of Arctic Circle and equator crossings. The remainder of my CV is in reverse chronological order, beginning with my most recent experience and working backwards through my major voyages. This also happens to organize my experience by vessel and allows me to expand on the locations I’ve sailed and any remarkable experiences I’ve had, such as the storm I encountered off the Cape of Good Hope. Because my ocean experience is much more extensive than my sailing before my bluewater voyages, I list my inshore racing, instructing, and tall ship coastal sail-training at the end of the CV under “Other Experience.”</p><p>Whatever your approach to constructing a sailing résumé, the most important thing is to convey clearly that you are qualified to operate the yacht you’d like to insure, crew aboard, or charter. The more experience you have on similar vessels, and in the waters where you plan to sail, the better. Experience of offshore sailing and challenging locations or circumstances is important to highlight as well. Even if you are planning to simply sail along the New England coast in summer, if you’ve sailed to Bermuda or offshore to Newfoundland, it’s likely the insurer will appreciate knowing that. </p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjEyMTM3NDE2NTk5ODA3NTIz/2025-03-march-subscribe.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"1195\">\n                        \n                    </figure>\n                    <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/48VZMQU\">Click Here to Subscribe</a></p><p>March 2025</p>",

Categories would consist of dinghies, small vessels, larger vessels (whether you express this by tonnage or length), catamarans, monohulls, power vessels, and sailing vessels. \n\n                        \n                        \n                        The author dressed for the weather in the Arctic. No matter where you sail, logging miles, dates, and boat type helps you write a sailing CV.\nPhoto courtesy of Ellen Massey\n\n                    \n                    \nIt’s also a good idea to break down your sea time by type of experience and locations. For example, I present my experience sailing my former 34-foot ketch up the Eastern Seaboard separately from my experience crossing the Pacific aboard my current 40-foot sloop. Even though they are similar vessels, one voyage was coastal sailing and the other involved extensive bluewater passages.\nFinally, it’s also helpful to break down your experience by your role on board: skipper, crew, watch captain, navigator, etc. And it’s a good idea to present recent experience—how many days or miles you’ve sailed in the last few months, the last year, and the last five years.\nAs to the form your résumé takes, the most important consideration is to make sure it’s easily understood. For some sailors this may take the form of a spreadsheet-type log, showing days (or miles) as captain, crew, etc.; days/miles in various types of vessels or individual boats; days/miles offshore versus coastal; days/miles in various locations or at various times of year; and days/miles in the most recent time periods. This method is similar to how aircraft pilots break down their experience and will make the most sense for those who have been logging their time consistently for a USCG license.\nBut, if you’re putting together a résumé for the first time after years of experience, it may make more sense to construct it much like a conventional job résumé, in reverse chronological order and highlighting the most relevant experience. My own sailing CV follows this “conventional résumé” approach; over the decades I’ve been sailing, I have not kept close track of each day I’ve spent at sea, but I do have a very accurate picture of the ocean miles I’ve sailed.\nI begin my sailing CV with a bullet-point summary. Certain things should be included in this list, especially certifications and boating safety courses. These are important to insurers and charter companies. In fact, it’s impossible to skipper a charter yacht in some Mediterranean countries without certain certifications—RYA Skipper, ICC (International Certificate of Competence), US Sailing Basic Keelboat, etc. \nIn my own bullet-point summary, my total sea miles head the list and are followed by my major voyages, my sailing awards, and some statistics like number of ocean crossings and number of Arctic Circle and equator crossings. The remainder of my CV is in reverse chronological order, beginning with my most recent experience and working backwards through my major voyages. This also happens to organize my experience by vessel and allows me to expand on the locations I’ve sailed and any remarkable experiences I’ve had, such as the storm I encountered off the Cape of Good Hope. Because my ocean experience is much more extensive than my sailing before my bluewater voyages, I list my inshore racing, instructing, and tall ship coastal sail-training at the end of the CV under “Other Experience.”\nWhatever your approach to constructing a sailing résumé, the most important thing is to convey clearly that you are qualified to operate the yacht you’d like to insure, crew aboard, or charter. The more experience you have on similar vessels, and in the waters where you plan to sail, the better. Experience of offshore sailing and challenging locations or circumstances is important to highlight as well. Even if you are planning to simply sail along the New England coast in summer, if you’ve sailed to Bermuda or offshore to Newfoundland, it’s likely the insurer will appreciate knowing that. \n\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \nClick Here to Subscribe\nMarch 2025",

The awards celebrate 16 contest categories representing $16,000 in cash prizes for \"excellence in creating compelling content about boating through entertaining, educational and inspiring journalism.\" Each of the 16 categories is judged by active journalists in the industry.</p><p>For a <a href=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/boats/sail-wins-big-at-annual-boating-writing-awards-\">second year in a row</a>, <em>SAIL</em> was the boating industry’s most celebrated publication, receiving 17 awards overall and five first prizes. </p><p>SAIL Editor-in-Chief Wendy Mitman Clarke took both <a href=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/cruising/from-the-editor-back-to-school\">first</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/cruising/from-the-editor-humble-pie\">third</a> places in the Boating Columns category sponsored by KVH Industries for her letters from the editor. Judges said of her work, “The author’s voice is loud and clear in each story, drawing heavily upon personal experience and a superior knowledge of sailing without being preachy. I found all three stories made for enjoyable, entertaining and informative reading.”</p><p>Managing Editor Lydia Mullan won—for the second consecutive year—the competitive Adventure category for her riveting story “<a href=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/racing/a-eulogy-for-alliance\">A Eulogy for <em>Alliance</em></a>” about the 2024 Bermuda Race when the J/122 on which she was crew hit a submerged object and sank. Of the story, judges said it was a “storm-powered adventure that braved the elements to deliver a uniquely engaging story.”</p><p>Mullan’s follow up article “<a href=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/cruising/seamanship-lessons-from-the-sinking-of-alliance\">Lessons from <em>Alliance</em></a><em>,”</em> was also recognized, taking second place in the Seamanship, Rescue, and Safety category sponsored by Sea Tow Services International.

Of Birch’s article, judges said, “The author cleverly juxtaposes a voyage to Newfoundland with an homage to writer Farley Mowat and his many seminal books about sailing the Canadian Maritime Provinces. The reader rides along as they cruise to small and abandoned villages, waterfalls and fjords, seeing for themselves the places that inspired the ‘Sage of Burgeo,’ and meeting the many people who call this special place home.\"<em> </em>Birch’s “<a href=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/diy/know-how-adding-windvane-steering-and-a-hydrogenerator\">A New Balance</a>” also came in second in the Boat Projects, Renovations, and Retrofits category sponsored by Boats Group. </p><figure><iframe  width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://content.jwplatform.com/players/WAAd7LGa-mWJKIymt.html\"\n        allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>SAIL Wins Big in the BWI Writing Awards (0:40) </figcaption></figure><p>Hugo Kugiya won first prize in the Boating Issues, News, and Analysis category sponsored by Mercury Marine for his story “Jumping on the Starwagon,”[ https://www.sailmagazine.com/gear/starlink-how-high-speed-internet-for-boats-is-changing-sailing] on Starlink and the rise of connected sailing.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "The Discover Boating Miami International Boat Show is an exciting point on every marine journalist’s calendar not just because of the gorgeous weather and menagerie of new designs on display. On day one before the show opens, Boating Writers International kicks off the festivities with their annual awards now in its 32nd year. The awards celebrate 16 contest categories representing $16,000 in cash prizes for \"excellence in creating compelling content about boating through entertaining, educational and inspiring journalism.\" Each of the 16 categories is judged by active journalists in the industry.\nFor a second year in a row, SAIL was the boating industry’s most celebrated publication, receiving 17 awards overall and five first prizes. \nSAIL Editor-in-Chief Wendy Mitman Clarke took both first and third places in the Boating Columns category sponsored by KVH Industries for her letters from the editor. Judges said of her work, “The author’s voice is loud and clear in each story, drawing heavily upon personal experience and a superior knowledge of sailing without being preachy. I found all three stories made for enjoyable, entertaining and informative reading.”\nManaging Editor Lydia Mullan won—for the second consecutive year—the competitive Adventure category for her riveting story “A Eulogy for Alliance” about the 2024 Bermuda Race when the J/122 on which she was crew hit a submerged object and sank. Of the story, judges said it was a “storm-powered adventure that braved the elements to deliver a uniquely engaging story.”\nMullan’s follow up article “Lessons from Alliance,” was also recognized, taking second place in the Seamanship, Rescue, and Safety category sponsored by Sea Tow Services International. Her story “Lightning in a Bottle” about Cole Brauer’s circumnavigation and managing the media campaign that took Instagram by storm took second place in the Women in Boating category sponsored by Yamaha Marine Business Unit/Yamaha Watercraft. \nCruising Editor Charles J. Doane received second place award in Boating Profiles sponsored by Nautical Ventures for “An Obsessive Sort of Sailor” and a merit award in the Lifestyles category sponsored by Discover Boating for his “More than A Dash of Grit.” Technical Editor Adam Cove took third in the Boat Tests and Reviews category sponsored by Volvo Penta for his writing on the X Yachts XC47, while\nSAIL contributors swept the Boating Travel or Destinations category sponsored by Dometic, with Christopher Birch in first with his article “Searching for Farley,”  Charles Scott’s “A Tall Ship Tale” in second, and Kia Koropp’s “The Hidden Gift”  in third. Of Birch’s article, judges said, “The author cleverly juxtaposes a voyage to Newfoundland with an homage to writer Farley Mowat and his many seminal books about sailing the Canadian Maritime Provinces. The reader rides along as they cruise to small and abandoned villages, waterfalls and fjords, seeing for themselves the places that inspired the ‘Sage of Burgeo,’ and meeting the many people who call this special place home.\" Birch’s “A New Balance” also came in second in the Boat Projects, Renovations, and Retrofits category sponsored by Boats Group. \nSAIL Wins Big in the BWI Writing Awards (0:40) \nHugo Kugiya won first prize in the Boating Issues, News, and Analysis category sponsored by Mercury Marine for his story “Jumping on the Starwagon,”[ https://www.sailmagazine.com/gear/starlink-how-high-speed-internet-for-boats-is-changing-sailing] on Starlink and the rise of connected sailing. Said judges, “this well-researched article delivers a compelling read about a truly breakthrough development being advanced by sailors in ports and waterways throughout the world.”\nNorris Comer took first in Women in Boating sponsored by Yamaha Marine Business Unit/Yamaha Watercraft for “Sails Like a Girl Lives Like a Wolf,” which the judges said “captures the essence of fear, bravery, and all the emotions that lay between. I felt connected to the subject and a part of her world.”\nBoating Photography sponsored by Duree & Co. recognized two SAIL contributors: Charles Scott and Nick Croken for a third place and merit award respectively, and Stephen Titus came in third in the Boating Adventures category sponsored by Yamaha Marine Group with his “Father Watch Son Watch.” \nSAIL received 17 awards in total and won first prize in five of sixteen categories, making it 2024’s most celebrated marine publication by both metrics. “I’m very, very proud of our writers and photographers,” says Clarke. “They do such great work.”\n“We’re not a huge magazine with a massive staff, but our editors and contributors are some of the hardest working people out there.

    "content:encoded": "<p>Standing in the aft cockpit of the new Leopard 46, my gaze is directed at the Leopard 50 parked across the dock. “It looks just about the same size,” says Franck Bauguil, global sales manager of the South African boatbuilder. “On the 46, we packed in almost everything that used to be on a boat 4 feet longer.” </p><figure><iframe  width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://content.jwplatform.com/players/FESarGPs-mWJKIymt.html\"\n        allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>Leopard 46 Walkthrough Video (2:32) </figcaption></figure><p>It seems a bit of sorcery but it’s true. Starting with a blank sheet, Leopard Catamarans and Simonis Voogd Design reimagined life on 46 feet. The new model feels much larger than its specifications suggest, and it’s poised to become a worthy successor to the popular Leopard 45 that launched 379 hulls since its introduction in 2017. Leopard embraced their formula for years primarily because it worked. Now they’re switching it up and taking risks. The majority of the changes are on the main deck between the salon and cockpit, in the cabin accommodations below, and with the option for a hybrid propulsion system. Let’s look at each in turn and add some details.</p><p>Recent catamaran design trends have embraced a more direct connection between the cockpit and the salon via massive opening doors and then stretching inline seating along one side. Leopard gave this a go. The four-panel glass door tucks neatly into the starboard casing below the helm station, creating uninterrupted movement between inside and outside. With a variety of table options for dining and relaxing, the long settee flows along the port side as the cockpit becomes the salon and vice versa. </p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjEyNjA1MDA1MTI2MDUxMzM3/06leopard-46-electric-drive-6813psd.jpg\" height=\"799\" width=\"1200\">\n                        <figcaption>The helm is located up and to starboard.<p>Photo courtesy of Leopard Catamarans</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>Across from the cockpit dinette, a chaise longue is the coveted spot aboard. Relax and look aft over the optional electric platform which extends the cockpit deck when the tender is launched. This platform is different from others of its kind. To help with loading and launching of the tender, it moves down and out, away from the swim steps where there’s more room to float the dinghy on before hoisting.</p><p>To starboard, steps lead from the cockpit to the helm, which was raised a few inches for better visibility forward. Two electric winches are standard, and another can be optioned so managing large sail loads becomes a push-button affair. With C-shaped seating and a sunpad on the adjacent bimini, the skipper never needs to stand watch alone. These “fly deck” lounges have gained popularity because they add space without raising the center of gravity as much as a full flybridge. They also improve the sightlines to the aft corners when you duck below the bimini, so docking is easier than from a flybridge helm that requires a backup camera. </p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjEyNjA1MDA1MTI1OTg1OTIw/03-leopard-46-electric-drive-6839-copy.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"1200\">\n                        <figcaption>The cockpit and salon become one space when the doors are fully opened.<p>Photo courtesy of Leopard Catamarans</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>Leopard stuck to their knitting in the salon with their usual forward galley offering a view over the foredeck that will take the pain out of washing dishes. My two favorite features are still here including Leopard’s signature front door that leads to the roomy forward cockpit. This door is the fastest way to get to the foredeck and the best way to cool down inside on a hot day. I’m also a fan of the port side forward facing navigation station with its wide comfortable seat that you could actually spend time on as you stand watch from inside. Even on charter, the nav desk is the nerve center of the boat, so kudos to Leopard for refusing to minimize its importance. </p><p>By peeling away the constraints of a traditional cabin layout, Leopard packed in a lot of living space. Three to five staterooms are available, all with en suite heads. The owner’s cabin is in the aft section of the starboard hull with its own entry steps. “You don’t really need the whole hull for a good master suite,” says Bauguil. “We found that two thirds of the length is plenty and it let us fit in more features throughout.”</p><p>One of those features is the utility room in the port forward hull where you can store loads of gear or use it as an office, laundry room, or workshop. For cruising, it will be indispensable, and for charter you can make it into another guest cabin. Up to five staterooms can be fitted by truncating the master and adding an over/under bunk cabin amidships with its own wet head for kids or crew. </p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjEyNjA1MDA1MTI1OTg1ODAx/04-leopard-46-electric-drive-6408-copy.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"1200\">\n                        <figcaption>The forward facing galley has one of the best views in the house.<p>Photo courtesy of Leopard Catamarans</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>“We finally eliminated the bow skipper cabins,” adds Bauguil. “The crews just refused to use them so now they can be inside the boat, which is more civilized.”</p><p>The Leopard 46 is powered by 45-hp or 57-hp Yanmar diesels, but hull No. 1 one debuted on U.S. shores with an optional hybrid drive propulsion system. In simplest terms, two 25kW electric pods combine with a 24kW range-extending generator and two 27kWh lithium-iron phosphate battery banks. The banks are identical but separate for redundancy should one side fail. Power regeneration is accomplished via shore power, the combustion engine generator, 1,600 watts of glass solar panels on the bimini, and hydrogeneration via the two 18-inch propellers spinning when under sail. Although regeneration starts at speeds as low as 5 knots, you’ll need to sail 8 knots or more to generate 1.5-1.8kW per hour per hull. At anchor, two 6kW inverters draw on the batteries to power house loads for a full day with just one hour of generator charging time. </p><p>It’s an impressive system designed in partnership with the La Rochelle-based Alternatives Energies. The brains of this 400-volt DC system is called OneBox and although highly sophisticated, details are presented on intuitive and layman-friendly screen interfaces. Significant automation also makes this complex system function seamlessly without the need for much human decision-making. “The generator automatically starts when the batteries discharge to 40%,” says Jeremy Benichou of Alternatives Energies. “It ensures you’re never out of juice and usually arrive at the anchorage topped up.”</p><p>A well-optioned diesel version of the Leopard 46 is priced at $1 million and you can expect to add upwards of another $140,000 for the same options plus the hybrid system and its vast lithium power storage. That’s not nothing, but it pays more than lip service to greener cruising.</p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjEyNjA1MDA1MTI2MTgyNTI4/07-leopard-46-electric-drive-6266.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"1200\">\n                        <figcaption>The owner's suite aft has its own access.&nbsp;<p>Photo courtesy of Leopard Catamarans</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>We took the new design out for a spin. Under batteries alone we made good 7.4 knots, and when the genset kicked in we reached 9.1 knots at full throttle. The faster you go under electric alone, the shorter the range, of course, but depending on sea state, you can expect to motor up to four hours at 6 knots on a full charge. That’s more than enough for short hops between anchorages or maneuvering around the marina. One drawback to the hybrid regen system is that it necessitates the use of fixed propellers, which induce drag of at least 1 knot under sail. With twin Yanmar diesels (eliminating the regen option) folding propellers can be fitted.</p><p>Of course, the Leopard 46 is a sailboat first, so we ventured out onto Chesapeake Bay and hoisted the upgraded aramid fiber laminated square-top main by Ullman Sails. Upwind sail area with the genoa is 1,512 square feet and you can add a code zero for downwind work. The mast is 3 feet taller now for better performance, and we sailed consistent low 7-knot speeds in 14 knots of true wind on a beam reach. We hardened up to 60 degrees apparent wind angle and slipped along steadily at 6-6.5 knots. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the large downwind sail to play with but with nearly 900 square feet flying, I’d expect double digit speeds in the right conditions. One thing I fully embraced during our sail was standing on the bimini to reach the sail bag and manage the canvas and lines without a lot of climbing. </p><p>Leopard sells boats to private owners and into charter with The Moorings/Sunsail. Traditionally, this has split 50/50 but the pandemic skewed the numbers when private owners flooded the market. Today, that ratio is shifting back toward charter. “For the first 50 units, 70% is slated for charter due to strong demand as fleets refresh,” says Bauguil. “Then it’ll shift back to 50/50. Hybrid propulsion is not targeted at charter.”</p><p>Leopard loosened its grip on the formula that made them successful for years and ventured into new directions in terms of livability and sustainability. The resulting fresh ideas are likely to proliferate through their future designs. Bauguil relaxes in the cockpit as we sail along. “We couldn’t be happier with how it turned out.” </p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjEyNjA1MDA1MTI2MTE2ODcz/leopard-46-specs.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"987\">\n                        <figcaption><p>Leopard Catamarans</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p><strong>LOA/LWL</strong><em> 47’6”/44’0”</em></p><p><strong>Beam</strong><em> 24’1”</em></p><p><strong>Draft</strong><em> 5’5”</em></p><p><strong>Air Draft</strong><em><strong> </strong>75’2”</em></p><p><strong>Bridgedeck Clearance </strong><em>3'4\"</em></p><p><strong>Displacement</strong><em> 38,925 lbs (light) </em></p><p><strong>Upwind Sail Area</strong><em> 1,512 sq ft </em></p><p><strong>Engines</strong><em> 2x45-57hp Yanmar or electric</em></p><p><strong>Designer</strong><em> Simonis Voogd Design</em></p><p><strong>Builder</strong><em> Leopard Catamarans, <a href=\"https://www.leopardcatamarans.com/\">leopardcatamarans.com</a></em></p><p><strong>Price</strong><em> $789,000 base, $999,000 well-optioned diesel version</em></p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjEyMTM3NDE2NTk5ODA3NTIz/2025-03-march-subscribe.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"1195\">\n                        \n                    </figure>\n                    <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/48VZMQU\">Click Here to Subscribe</a></p><p>April 2025</p>",

The new model feels much larger than its specifications suggest, and it’s poised to become a worthy successor to the popular Leopard 45 that launched 379 hulls since its introduction in 2017. Leopard embraced their formula for years primarily because it worked. Now they’re switching it up and taking risks. The majority of the changes are on the main deck between the salon and cockpit, in the cabin accommodations below, and with the option for a hybrid propulsion system. Let’s look at each in turn and add some details.\nRecent catamaran design trends have embraced a more direct connection between the cockpit and the salon via massive opening doors and then stretching inline seating along one side. Leopard gave this a go. The four-panel glass door tucks neatly into the starboard casing below the helm station, creating uninterrupted movement between inside and outside. With a variety of table options for dining and relaxing, the long settee flows along the port side as the cockpit becomes the salon and vice versa. \n\n                        \n                        \n                        The helm is located up and to starboard.\nPhoto courtesy of Leopard Catamarans\n\n                    \n                    \nAcross from the cockpit dinette, a chaise longue is the coveted spot aboard. Relax and look aft over the optional electric platform which extends the cockpit deck when the tender is launched. This platform is different from others of its kind. To help with loading and launching of the tender, it moves down and out, away from the swim steps where there’s more room to float the dinghy on before hoisting.\nTo starboard, steps lead from the cockpit to the helm, which was raised a few inches for better visibility forward. Two electric winches are standard, and another can be optioned so managing large sail loads becomes a push-button affair. With C-shaped seating and a sunpad on the adjacent bimini, the skipper never needs to stand watch alone. These “fly deck” lounges have gained popularity because they add space without raising the center of gravity as much as a full flybridge. They also improve the sightlines to the aft corners when you duck below the bimini, so docking is easier than from a flybridge helm that requires a backup camera. \n\n                        \n                        \n                        The cockpit and salon become one space when the doors are fully opened.\nPhoto courtesy of Leopard Catamarans\n\n                    \n                    \nLeopard stuck to their knitting in the salon with their usual forward galley offering a view over the foredeck that will take the pain out of washing dishes. My two favorite features are still here including Leopard’s signature front door that leads to the roomy forward cockpit. This door is the fastest way to get to the foredeck and the best way to cool down inside on a hot day. I’m also a fan of the port side forward facing navigation station with its wide comfortable seat that you could actually spend time on as you stand watch from inside. Even on charter, the nav desk is the nerve center of the boat, so kudos to Leopard for refusing to minimize its importance. \nBy peeling away the constraints of a traditional cabin layout, Leopard packed in a lot of living space. Three to five staterooms are available, all with en suite heads. The owner’s cabin is in the aft section of the starboard hull with its own entry steps. “You don’t really need the whole hull for a good master suite,” says Bauguil. “We found that two thirds of the length is plenty and it let us fit in more features throughout.”\nOne of those features is the utility room in the port forward hull where you can store loads of gear or use it as an office, laundry room, or workshop. For cruising, it will be indispensable, and for charter you can make it into another guest cabin. Up to five staterooms can be fitted by truncating the master and adding an over/under bunk cabin amidships with its own wet head for kids or crew. \n\n                        \n                        \n                        The forward facing galley has one of the best views in the house.\nPhoto courtesy of Leopard Catamarans\n\n                    \n                    \n“We finally eliminated the bow skipper cabins,” adds Bauguil. “The crews just refused to use them so now they can be inside the boat, which is more civilized.”\nThe Leopard 46 is powered by 45-hp or 57-hp Yanmar diesels, but hull No. 1 one debuted on U.S. shores with an optional hybrid drive propulsion system. In simplest terms, two 25kW electric pods combine with a 24kW range-extending generator and two 27kWh lithium-iron phosphate battery banks. The banks are identical but separate for redundancy should one side fail. Power regeneration is accomplished via shore power, the combustion engine generator, 1,600 watts of glass solar panels on the bimini, and hydrogeneration via the two 18-inch propellers spinning when under sail. Although regeneration starts at speeds as low as 5 knots, you’ll need to sail 8 knots or more to generate 1.5-1.8kW per hour per hull. At anchor, two 6kW inverters draw on the batteries to power house loads for a full day with just one hour of generator charging time. \nIt’s an impressive system designed in partnership with the La Rochelle-based Alternatives Energies. The brains of this 400-volt DC system is called OneBox and although highly sophisticated, details are presented on intuitive and layman-friendly screen interfaces. Significant automation also makes this complex system function seamlessly without the need for much human decision-making. “The generator automatically starts when the batteries discharge to 40%,” says Jeremy Benichou of Alternatives Energies. “It ensures you’re never out of juice and usually arrive at the anchorage topped up.”\nA well-optioned diesel version of the Leopard 46 is priced at $1 million and you can expect to add upwards of another $140,000 for the same options plus the hybrid system and its vast lithium power storage. That’s not nothing, but it pays more than lip service to greener cruising.\n\n                        \n                        \n                        The owner's suite aft has its own access. \nPhoto courtesy of Leopard Catamarans\n\n                    \n                    \nWe took the new design out for a spin. Under batteries alone we made good 7.4 knots, and when the genset kicked in we reached 9.1 knots at full throttle. The faster you go under electric alone, the shorter the range, of course, but depending on sea state, you can expect to motor up to four hours at 6 knots on a full charge. That’s more than enough for short hops between anchorages or maneuvering around the marina. One drawback to the hybrid regen system is that it necessitates the use of fixed propellers, which induce drag of at least 1 knot under sail. With twin Yanmar diesels (eliminating the regen option) folding propellers can be fitted.\nOf course, the Leopard 46 is a sailboat first, so we ventured out onto Chesapeake Bay and hoisted the upgraded aramid fiber laminated square-top main by Ullman Sails. Upwind sail area with the genoa is 1,512 square feet and you can add a code zero for downwind work. The mast is 3 feet taller now for better performance, and we sailed consistent low 7-knot speeds in 14 knots of true wind on a beam reach. We hardened up to 60 degrees apparent wind angle and slipped along steadily at 6-6.5 knots. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the large downwind sail to play with but with nearly 900 square feet flying, I’d expect double digit speeds in the right conditions. One thing I fully embraced during our sail was standing on the bimini to reach the sail bag and manage the canvas and lines without a lot of climbing. \nLeopard sells boats to private owners and into charter with The Moorings/Sunsail. Traditionally, this has split 50/50 but the pandemic skewed the numbers when private owners flooded the market. Today, that ratio is shifting back toward charter. “For the first 50 units, 70% is slated for charter due to strong demand as fleets refresh,” says Bauguil. “Then it’ll shift back to 50/50. Hybrid propulsion is not targeted at charter.”\nLeopard loosened its grip on the formula that made them successful for years and ventured into new directions in terms of livability and sustainability. The resulting fresh ideas are likely to proliferate through their future designs. Bauguil relaxes in the cockpit as we sail along. “We couldn’t be happier with how it turned out.” \n\n                        \n                        \n                        \nLeopard Catamarans\n\n                    \n                    \nLOA/LWL 47’6”/44’0”\nBeam 24’1”\nDraft 5’5”\nAir Draft 75’2”\nBridgedeck Clearance 3'4\"\nDisplacement 38,925 lbs (light) \nUpwind Sail Area 1,512 sq ft \nEngines 2x45-57hp Yanmar or electric\nDesigner Simonis Voogd Design\nBuilder Leopard Catamarans, leopardcatamarans.com\nPrice $789,000 base, $999,000 well-optioned diesel version\n\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \nClick Here to Subscribe\nApril 2025",

We went through the junior sailing program at Royal Victoria Yacht Club in British Columbia, we raced against and cruised with each other in dinghies and keelboats, and as adults we sailed many miles offshore together. During the spring of 2007, he called me about his son. “Sam’s finishing high school and plans to take a year off,” said Nick. “What do you think about taking him on a delivery with you this fall?” </p><p>I was a little surprised that he’d trust his eldest to me—after all, Nick knows my whole history—but I’d done something similar at Sam’s age and was delighted to pass on the experience. I’d recently been hired to skipper the late Sir Peter Blake’s former around-the-world race boat, Ceramco NZ, a Farr-designed 68-footer, from Newport, Rhode Island, to the Virgin Islands for the winter. There would be plenty of room for a young and strong—if inexperienced—crewmember. </p><p>Sam grew up sailing on his family’s Santa Cruz 27 on Wabamun Lake, near Edmonton, Alberta, but he had little idea what to expect offshore, so I thought about what I wish I’d known before my first passage.</p><p><strong>One of your highest priorities should be to stay warm and dry.</strong></p><p>Our route from Newport to Bermuda to the Virgins is furrowed with wakes each fall, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t challenging; in fact, it can be dangerous. (While we waited out weather in Bermuda, two people were lost as they tried to abandon their boat 300 miles south of Newport in the remnants of Hurricane Noel.) It would be chilly when we left at the end of October, but that’s when hurricanes become rare and before winter storms become too frequent. </p><p>Traveling light would be difficult because the conditions demand that crewmembers carry a wide range of clothing. I told Sam that we usually start out wearing full foul-weather gear with a fleece top; a good, heavy midlayer; and long johns underneath.</p><p>Gloves and a warm, windproof fleece hat round out the ensemble.</p><p>I loaned Sam my spare foul-weather gear and some fleece-lined, windproof salopettes; he had his own seaboots. “Given that temperatures could be near the freezing mark,” I said, “one of your highest priorities should be to stay warm and dry. Once you get wet, it’s easy to get cold and then for hypothermia to set in, rendering you useless or, worse, a liability.” </p><p>Take socks for the first two days only, I advised. The rest of the time you’ll be barefoot or wearing shoes without them. South of Bermuda, the weather starts warming, and it eventually becomes tropical as we near the Caribbean. A few short-sleeved T-shirts, a long-sleeved shirt for sun protection, a bathing suit, and several pairs of shorts will probably be the only clothing you’ll need. Bring a camera. To pack it all, I told Sam to make sure he brought soft luggage-hard suitcases would only get him laughed at. I pack my gear that absolutely has to stay dry in a dry bag just in case of deck leaks.</p><p><strong>If it’s really rough, shift into four-wheel drive</strong></p><p>Sam had my spare safety harness, and I went over the quick-stop method of picking up a man overboard with him and the rest of the crew. But I emphasized to everyone that their chances of rescue are slim if they go over the side. Therefore, we always wear our harnesses and clip in at night and in dodgy weather. Since nautical lore has it that most drowned sailors are found with their flies open, we never pee over the rail offshore; we always use the head. </p><p>Brace yourself.

Remember the old sea dog’s advice: “One hand for the ship, one hand for yourself!”</p><p><br> In rough weather, it’s especially important to keep a low center of gravity; if it’s really rough, shift into four-wheel-drive, moving about on your hands and knees. </p><p>Stay sober.

When we arrive, it makes the first one taste that much better.</p><p>One last thing about crew overboard: If you’re below and you hear the cry that someone’s gone over, grab your harness and get it on before you head up the companionway, then clip in as you exit the companionway. Know where your harness is at all times, and how to put it on in the dark. It’s easy to go over the side in the confusion of a crew-overboard situation, and two people in the drink is way worse than just one.</p><p><strong>On watch means keeping an eye out for things we can bump into, but that’s not all</strong></p><p>When you’re on watch, the boat and everyone aboard are in your hands. First of all, you’re on watch. Keep a good eye out for ships and other things we might hit. But it doesn’t stop there: In addition to scanning the horizon and the sky for impending weather, a good offshore sailor will be looking around the boat and the rig all the time. A small tear in a sail is easy to fix if spotted early, but it’s not so easy to deal with once the sail rips from leech to luff. A mainsheet-block shackle pin that’s starting to back out is no problem to screw in if you notice it when it’s halfway out, but what a pain it is to corral a wildly swinging boom after the pin disappears into orbit. Another word about being on watch: Before you go below, make sure that all the lines are coiled, the water bottles are picked up, and your personal gear goes with you. As Welsh yachtsman Roy Williams is fond of pointing out, “A tidy boat is a happy boat.” </p><p>As far as possible, we standardize the way we perform certain operations. Every captain does things his or her own way-and they’re almost all correct, as long as everyone’s on the same page—but on my boat, lines are cleated with a round turn, a diagonal cross, and a half-hitch that ends with the tail parallel to the first cross. Sheets and halyards that are in use will be coiled in a figure eight between the winch and your up-turned palm. And self-tailing winches will always have a “safety turn” around the drum after the line exits the self-tailer. If we follow this routine, when problems come up, anyone coming on deck will be able to undo a line in the dark.</p><p>Standard procedure on the boat involves little sleep for me the first day or so. My rule is that if you see anything, call the captain. If you have any doubts about anything, call the captain. If you can’t decide whether to call the captain, call the captain. I’ll stick my head up and either help you to deal with the problem or decide it’s nothing, but I’d always rather be woken.</p><p><strong>Line up the headstay with a cloud, then just glance at the compass every now and again</strong></p><p>The autopilot didn’t work on Ceramco NZ. That was all right: With a crew of six, we’d have plenty of hands, and she’s a fun boat to drive. Still, Sam found that she felt a little different from a 27-footer on the lake. Sam had shown me that he was a good helmsman during sea trials on Ceramco NZ, but he’d be sailing in waves for the first time. </p><p>When we’re offshore, we sail a compass course, and the waves are always trying to send us off course. A common mistake neophytes make is to fix their gaze on the compass and try to keep the boat right on the mark. But that’s almost impossible; you end up overcorrecting because the lubber line only tells you where you are at that moment. Besides, it’s boring to just stare at the compass. To keep the boat on course, line the headstay up with a cloud or a star-remember poet John Masefield’s desire for “a star to steer her by”—then just glance at the compass every now and again for reference. </p><p>The other secret to steering in waves is anticipating what the boat will do when a wave rolls under it. Part of this involves getting a feel for the boat you’re on, but generally boats behave in the same way. Quartering seas—that is, seas that are coming from the aft corner of the boat—are the most difficult in which to steer. Try to keep the boat under the mast. When a wave comes and the boat rolls to leeward, it’ll want to round up to weather. As the wave starts to roll under the stern you’ll feel it in the soles of your feet and from pressure on the wheel; this is the time to put the helm up, steering to leeward slightly. As the wave passes, the boat will come more upright, and the wave will try to pull the bow to leeward—you’ll feel it; this is the time to put the helm down a bit. This can be trying at first, but with practice it can be the most delightful rhythm, and it makes your watch pass quickly.</p><p><strong>Living on a boat is like living in a very small town</strong></p><p>In the big city, you’re anonymous; you can be as selfish as you like. But living on a boat is like living in a very small town: All your neighbors know you far too well. They know what’s in your seabag, that you snore like a Harley, and more than they ever wanted to about your personal hygiene. Everything you do on the boat affects the rest of the crew. So keep your bunk tidy, put your clothes away, do your chores without having to be asked, don’t mess up the galley, and try to be quiet so you don’t wake those who are sleeping. </p><p>One thing that can be pretty unpleasant—especially once we reach the tropics—Is the head. It’s important to keep it clean or it will reek, and when the hatches are all closed, it’s worse. If we’re in rough weather, gentlemen are requested to take a seat. If your aim is momentarily bad, clean up after yourself. After taking a shower, dry the head with a chamois or an old towel.Unless we’ve eaten it first, we never put anything in the head-with the exception of a minimum amount of T.P. I don’t need to tell you what kind of a job it is to take apart and unclog the head while we’re bouncing around at sea.</p><p><strong>Things never go quite as planned, so keep a positive attitude</strong></p><p>If it’s windy and rough, just remember that nothing lasts forever. The worst weather will pass, and the seas will subside; eventually, you’ll have the memory of some incredible scenery and a couple of good sea stories. Keep your head, and the fact that we were all terrified will fade away by the second telling of the tale. Above all, keep a positive attitude. If you bitch and moan about how terrible the situation is, you’ll just bring everyone on board down. They already know things are bad; they don’t need you to tell them. Life never quite goes as planned when you’re at sea on a small boat—and they’re all small boats out there—but if you have the right outlook you’ll be able to accept that some things just can’t be changed. Morale is much better if we all just grin and joke and try to make the best of any situation. </p><p><em>CCA Member and Author Andy Burton has more than 450,000 miles under his keel, both as a professional delivery captain and on his personal boats.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "The Cruising Club of America (CCA) is a collection of 1,400 ocean sailors with extensive offshore seamanship, command experience, and a shared passion for making adventurous use of the seas. Their experiences and expertise make them, collectively, one of the most reliable sources of information on offshore sailing. In partnership with SAIL, the CCA is sharing some of this hard-won know-how in SAIL e-newsletters.\n\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \nFor years, Nick Thornton and I sailed together. We went through the junior sailing program at Royal Victoria Yacht Club in British Columbia, we raced against and cruised with each other in dinghies and keelboats, and as adults we sailed many miles offshore together. During the spring of 2007, he called me about his son. “Sam’s finishing high school and plans to take a year off,” said Nick. “What do you think about taking him on a delivery with you this fall?” \nI was a little surprised that he’d trust his eldest to me—after all, Nick knows my whole history—but I’d done something similar at Sam’s age and was delighted to pass on the experience. I’d recently been hired to skipper the late Sir Peter Blake’s former around-the-world race boat, Ceramco NZ, a Farr-designed 68-footer, from Newport, Rhode Island, to the Virgin Islands for the winter. There would be plenty of room for a young and strong—if inexperienced—crewmember. \nSam grew up sailing on his family’s Santa Cruz 27 on Wabamun Lake, near Edmonton, Alberta, but he had little idea what to expect offshore, so I thought about what I wish I’d known before my first passage.\nOne of your highest priorities should be to stay warm and dry.\nOur route from Newport to Bermuda to the Virgins is furrowed with wakes each fall, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t challenging; in fact, it can be dangerous. (While we waited out weather in Bermuda, two people were lost as they tried to abandon their boat 300 miles south of Newport in the remnants of Hurricane Noel.) It would be chilly when we left at the end of October, but that’s when hurricanes become rare and before winter storms become too frequent. \nTraveling light would be difficult because the conditions demand that crewmembers carry a wide range of clothing. I told Sam that we usually start out wearing full foul-weather gear with a fleece top; a good, heavy midlayer; and long johns underneath.\nGloves and a warm, windproof fleece hat round out the ensemble.\nI loaned Sam my spare foul-weather gear and some fleece-lined, windproof salopettes; he had his own seaboots. “Given that temperatures could be near the freezing mark,” I said, “one of your highest priorities should be to stay warm and dry.

    "content:encoded": "<p>Many new boats show up at the Annapolis Sailboat Show via ship or truck, some on their own bottom from another East Coast port. The Allures 51.9 arrived under sail from Maine fresh off the Viking route, the Swiss couple who owned her having crossed the Atlantic via Scotland, Iceland, and Greenland. That itinerary sums up quite succintly what this Top 10 Best Boat winner is all about—the ability to explore waters less traveled sailing shorthanded and in profound comfort and self-sufficiency.</p><p>The Chesapeake Bay was hardly a proving ground for this 54-footer. As I stepped onboard for our test sail after the show, I got the distinct sense she was ready to stretch her legs again in open water, the fjords of Norway, Svalbard, or the Strait of Magellan calling. </p><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"560\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bJ9qpKQbwcQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Ready for all latitudes, the 51.9’s hull—3/16 to 3/8 inches (5-10 mm) thick—is 5083 aluminum, providing excellent corrosion resistance and exceptional strength after welding. It is reinforced with a carefully engineered network of aluminum stringers, frames, and bulkheads. Optional 1.5-inch soft foam insulation, starting near the waterline, separates the hull and structure from the interior. The deck and cabin top are foam-cored fiberglass, contributing to a lower center of gravity and adding natural insulation. These two material technologies are married with aluminum fasteners and an adhesive sealant. </p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjEyNDg1ODM2NDI2NTg1NjA5/04-20210927_ay_a519_interieur_210928all_2jml3161_hd-copy.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"1199\">\n                        <figcaption><em>The cockpit is comprised of distinct areas; the forward area is under cover and ideal for socializing and relaxing under sail.</em><p>Photo by Jean-Marie Liot&comma; courtesy of Allures</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>The Allures can draw as little as 4 feet, 5 inches thanks to the centerboard design that draws 9 feet, 7 inches when down. Over 13,000 pounds of ballast low in the hull creates the righting moment to counter the nearly 73-foot, deck-stepped Seldén aluminum mast (Sparcraft is standard) that carries 1,277 square feet of upwind sail area. </p><p>A cutter rig maintains a flexible sailplan for a shorthanded crew. Each build is customizable, and in this case, the owners opted for electric in-mast furling and a triple spreader rig that puts the D1 chainplates farther inboard, creating clear access to the foredeck. A manual continuous furler for the code zero adorned the bowsprit, while an electric Seldén furler handled the genoa. The staysail was furled on a manual Seldén drum. </p><p>The optional bow and retractable stern thrusters placed the Allures 51.9 exactly where she needed to be for an easy exit via the boat-filled marina passageway. If it weren’t for our noticeable boatspeed and the engine instruments, it would have been tough to know the Volvo Penta (now standard with 115-hp Nanni) was running; it was nearly silent, even as we increased the throttle in more open water. The folding three-blade Gori propeller should also take some credit for the level of smoothness. </p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjEyNDg1ODM2NDI2NTIwMTky/01-20210927_ay_a519_interieur_210928all_2jml3134_hd-copy.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"1199\">\n                        <figcaption><em>The salon has massive headroom and space yet retains a warm, welcoming atmosphere.&nbsp;</em><p>Photo by Jean-Marie Liot&comma; courtesy of Allures</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>In a 10-knot southerly we casually unfurled the Elvstrøm main and genoa. Everything was at our fingertips in the cockpit and adjacent to the twin helms. Hardening up on the wind was a push-button operation on the Lewmar winches and a light touch of one of the leather-covered stainless wheels. The Allures 51.9 accelerated to just over 5 knots and held tight at a 45 degrees true wind angle. </p><p>The easy sailing and light air gave me time to chat with the owners, who told of spending weeks dodging icebergs off Greenland. While reluctant to leave, they also looked forward to the adventures ahead on the northern U.S. East Coast, which they plan to explore further this upcoming spring and summer. Their Allures 51.9 opens opportunities for them to sail areas that other boats simply can’t reach, whether bound by their draft or inability to handle harsh climates. It offers the flexibility they required to head to higher latitudes and observe their passion for nature. </p><p>My tour belowdecks made it clear that this boat was their sanctuary, carefully built and outfitted to their vision.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Many new boats show up at the Annapolis Sailboat Show via ship or truck, some on their own bottom from another East Coast port. The Allures 51.9 arrived under sail from Maine fresh off the Viking route, the Swiss couple who owned her having crossed the Atlantic via Scotland, Iceland, and Greenland. That itinerary sums up quite succintly what this Top 10 Best Boat winner is all about—the ability to explore waters less traveled sailing shorthanded and in profound comfort and self-sufficiency.\nThe Chesapeake Bay was hardly a proving ground for this 54-footer. As I stepped onboard for our test sail after the show, I got the distinct sense she was ready to stretch her legs again in open water, the fjords of Norway, Svalbard, or the Strait of Magellan calling. \n\nReady for all latitudes, the 51.9’s hull—3/16 to 3/8 inches (5-10 mm) thick—is 5083 aluminum, providing excellent corrosion resistance and exceptional strength after welding. It is reinforced with a carefully engineered network of aluminum stringers, frames, and bulkheads. Optional 1.5-inch soft foam insulation, starting near the waterline, separates the hull and structure from the interior. The deck and cabin top are foam-cored fiberglass, contributing to a lower center of gravity and adding natural insulation. These two material technologies are married with aluminum fasteners and an adhesive sealant. \n\n                        \n                        \n                        The cockpit is comprised of distinct areas; the forward area is under cover and ideal for socializing and relaxing under sail.\nPhoto by Jean-Marie Liot, courtesy of Allures\n\n                    \n                    \nThe Allures can draw as little as 4 feet, 5 inches thanks to the centerboard design that draws 9 feet, 7 inches when down. Over 13,000 pounds of ballast low in the hull creates the righting moment to counter the nearly 73-foot, deck-stepped Seldén aluminum mast (Sparcraft is standard) that carries 1,277 square feet of upwind sail area. \nA cutter rig maintains a flexible sailplan for a shorthanded crew. Each build is customizable, and in this case, the owners opted for electric in-mast furling and a triple spreader rig that puts the D1 chainplates farther inboard, creating clear access to the foredeck. A manual continuous furler for the code zero adorned the bowsprit, while an electric Seldén furler handled the genoa. The staysail was furled on a manual Seldén drum. \nThe optional bow and retractable stern thrusters placed the Allures 51.9 exactly where she needed to be for an easy exit via the boat-filled marina passageway. If it weren’t for our noticeable boatspeed and the engine instruments, it would have been tough to know the Volvo Penta (now standard with 115-hp Nanni) was running; it was nearly silent, even as we increased the throttle in more open water. The folding three-blade Gori propeller should also take some credit for the level of smoothness. \n\n                        \n                        \n                        The salon has massive headroom and space yet retains a warm, welcoming atmosphere. \nPhoto by Jean-Marie Liot, courtesy of Allures\n\n                    \n                    \nIn a 10-knot southerly we casually unfurled the Elvstrøm main and genoa. Everything was at our fingertips in the cockpit and adjacent to the twin helms. Hardening up on the wind was a push-button operation on the Lewmar winches and a light touch of one of the leather-covered stainless wheels. The Allures 51.9 accelerated to just over 5 knots and held tight at a 45 degrees true wind angle. \nThe easy sailing and light air gave me time to chat with the owners, who told of spending weeks dodging icebergs off Greenland. While reluctant to leave, they also looked forward to the adventures ahead on the northern U.S. East Coast, which they plan to explore further this upcoming spring and summer. Their Allures 51.9 opens opportunities for them to sail areas that other boats simply can’t reach, whether bound by their draft or inability to handle harsh climates. It offers the flexibility they required to head to higher latitudes and observe their passion for nature. \nMy tour belowdecks made it clear that this boat was their sanctuary, carefully built and outfitted to their vision. The headroom is immediately noticeable and is even more apparent in the sunken galley to port. Designed to be extremely secure in a seaway, it’s also an elegant space. A large drawer freezer and fridge, and a second freezer set off to starboard, help with long-distance provisioning. A gimbaled three-burner propane stove is directly across from a large sink with an optional filtered water faucet. Large storage lockers underneath the cabin sole provide easy access to long-term provisions. \nThe inviting salon remains the focal point, with wraparound seating that forms an L and bench seating across. A chart and cruising guide were laid out across the table, barely covering a third of it; this lowers to provide an additional berth.\nThe nav station, adjacent to the salon area, provides generous mounting space for electronics while maintaining a clean look. A DC isolation monitor for the hull ensures any stray currents are detected; this is also home to the Scheiber tank control system for monitoring and transfers of the 185 total gallons of water (two tanks) and up to 264 gallons of diesel (three tanks). \nThe primary cabin is aft, through a short corridor that is home to loads of storage, an optional washer-dryer, the second freezer mentioned earlier, and a wet locker with vented warm air. This passageway also provides convenient access to the watermaker and engine room.  \nThe cabin, better described as a suite, is also loaded with storage. That’s not even counting the capacity under the bed, easily accessed by a hinge and gas springs. A lounge adorns the port side, along with an en suite head with a separate shower. \n\n                        \n                        \n                        The sunken galley is an elegant space that remains extremely seaworthy, practical, and loaded with storage.\nPhoto by Jean-Marie Liot, courtesy of Allures\n\n                    \n                    \nA large guest cabin, also offering plentiful storage, is all the way forward.

    "content:encoded": "<p>Late last summer while standup paddling, I watched a fisherman glide up atop a seafoam green multihulled paddleboard. Though pushed along by a trolling motor, he was gracious enough to stop for a quick overview of his 14-foot Live Watersports L4 Expedition. The dude was armed: battery box, tackle box, a Yeti cooler seat, a side track/rail system to hold rods, a cupholder, and a paddle. He’d fashioned a throttle control handle from a length of PVC and simply slipped it over the end of the tiller handle to pilot from mid-board. An aluminum bolt-on mount held the motor and beige no-slip EVA decking kept his feet cool. It was bad ass.</p><p>I’d seen these setups before on social media. Jimmy Buffett even had a Live 12-foot “Mango” fishing model he co-designed with company founder John Cleckner. Buffett used to strap his to a flats boat to reach yet skinnier water. My son was in search of a small boat for himself wondered how one of these 70-pound multihulls—fitted with a gas kicker—might compare to a 600-pound skiff for our local waters. I pinged Cleckner and soon enough was shoving off with a $3,099, twin-hulled L4 Expedition “microskiff” from our backyard dock. Instantly, I discovered that these boards make tons of fishing sense. First, they’re incredibly stable. Second, the cat design means they draw mere inches of water depending on how close you are to their 700-pound load limit, and third, with their sleek sponsons, they’re incredibly quiet on the flats where a ripple on a hull could spook a jumpy red or bonefish. </p><p>Since then, my son and his friends and I have experimented with the board—a lot. The L4 is pretty heavy. One can lug it, but a two-wheeled trailer is better. It paddles very fast and is remarkably maneuverable for its size. It is quite high-sided though, so with a beam breeze, staying on course requires considerable effort in any wind over 8 knots (a good excuse for a tandem-paddling date). Our board also came with two FCS surfboard fins that snap into boxes at the back of each sponson. These do help maintain direction in mild following seas and crosswinds, but they also increase the draft by 6 inches and catch on marsh grass if you’re in seriously skinny water—so just unsnap them when you reach your flat. To hold position, you could mount a mini power-pole (yes, they actually sell these), but we just throw out a small anchor. </p><p>My eager son bought a 6-horsepower short-shaft Yamaha kicker off Craigslist. We thumb-screwed the incredibly lightweight, SUP Customs motor mount to the stern and bolted on the gasser. We quickly learned that the mount, motor, and human weighs the stern down when you’re trying to start the motor. You can counteract that with another human or a big battery or ice-filled cooler up front, but barring that you’re on your knees right at the waterline to pull start—a wet and unstable process. And even with a counterweight, don’t expect choking, priming, starting, and running a gas motor—while attached to a kill switch—to be simple. We also found that while L4’s are sleek and gorgeous, a 6-horsepower outboard is only fun to maybe 15 knots. They are just not meant to go the considerable speed a 6 (or higher)-horsepower kicker can push them and you’ll chine walk without the fins.  </p><p>No, the elegant solution is an electric drive and a good deep cycle or lithium battery. We kept it simple, with a Minn-Kota trolling motor and a forward AGM that keeps the speed around 4 to 5 knots. The board’s so stable that we have yet to dump anything overboard. Mostly though, I prefer engine-less simplicity; paddling to a secret spot near home to cast from the board or sand never gets old. I get a solid workout, and I’m much more in tune with all the wildlife—especially the dolphins and tailing reds. And that, to me, is what these remarkable paddleboards are truly all about. <br></p><p><strong>LOA</strong>: 14’<br><strong>Beam</strong>: 2’10”<br><strong>Weight</strong>: 70 lbs<br><strong>Draft</strong>: 2-3”<br><strong>Price</strong>: $3,099<br><a href=\"https://www.livewatersports.com/boards/l4expedition\">Live L4 Expedition Paddleboard</a></p><p>For more multihull reviews and stories, <a href=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/multihull\">subscribe for free to Multihull Power & Sail</a></p><p>MHP&S Winter 2025</p>",

My son was in search of a small boat for himself wondered how one of these 70-pound multihulls—fitted with a gas kicker—might compare to a 600-pound skiff for our local waters. I pinged Cleckner and soon enough was shoving off with a $3,099, twin-hulled L4 Expedition “microskiff” from our backyard dock. Instantly, I discovered that these boards make tons of fishing sense. First, they’re incredibly stable. Second, the cat design means they draw mere inches of water depending on how close you are to their 700-pound load limit, and third, with their sleek sponsons, they’re incredibly quiet on the flats where a ripple on a hull could spook a jumpy red or bonefish. \nSince then, my son and his friends and I have experimented with the board—a lot. The L4 is pretty heavy. One can lug it, but a two-wheeled trailer is better. It paddles very fast and is remarkably maneuverable for its size. It is quite high-sided though, so with a beam breeze, staying on course requires considerable effort in any wind over 8 knots (a good excuse for a tandem-paddling date). Our board also came with two FCS surfboard fins that snap into boxes at the back of each sponson. These do help maintain direction in mild following seas and crosswinds, but they also increase the draft by 6 inches and catch on marsh grass if you’re in seriously skinny water—so just unsnap them when you reach your flat. To hold position, you could mount a mini power-pole (yes, they actually sell these), but we just throw out a small anchor. \nMy eager son bought a 6-horsepower short-shaft Yamaha kicker off Craigslist. We thumb-screwed the incredibly lightweight, SUP Customs motor mount to the stern and bolted on the gasser. We quickly learned that the mount, motor, and human weighs the stern down when you’re trying to start the motor. You can counteract that with another human or a big battery or ice-filled cooler up front, but barring that you’re on your knees right at the waterline to pull start—a wet and unstable process. And even with a counterweight, don’t expect choking, priming, starting, and running a gas motor—while attached to a kill switch—to be simple. We also found that while L4’s are sleek and gorgeous, a 6-horsepower outboard is only fun to maybe 15 knots. They are just not meant to go the considerable speed a 6 (or higher)-horsepower kicker can push them and you’ll chine walk without the fins.  \nNo, the elegant solution is an electric drive and a good deep cycle or lithium battery. We kept it simple, with a Minn-Kota trolling motor and a forward AGM that keeps the speed around 4 to 5 knots. The board’s so stable that we have yet to dump anything overboard. Mostly though, I prefer engine-less simplicity; paddling to a secret spot near home to cast from the board or sand never gets old. I get a solid workout, and I’m much more in tune with all the wildlife—especially the dolphins and tailing reds. And that, to me, is what these remarkable paddleboards are truly all about. \n\nLOA: 14’\nBeam: 2’10”\nWeight: 70 lbs\nDraft: 2-3”\nPrice: $3,099\nLive L4 Expedition Paddleboard\nFor more multihull reviews and stories, subscribe for free to Multihull Power & Sail\nMHP&S Winter 2025",

The placement provides surprisingly good visibility despite how low down they are. One snag I hit was that the polarization in my sunglasses made the starboard screen hard to read from the most natural place to steer from, but a little step to the side to improve the angle wasn’t an imposition. Like any design update, it just takes some getting used to, and though unconventional, this outboard instrument solution adds more space back into the cockpit, allowing for it to genuinely give the impression of being a bigger boat than it is. A Raymarine Axiom Pro 9 S chartplotter is located at the cockpit table for more in-depth information, and it can be upgraded to a Raymarine Axiom Pro 12 S if desired. </p><p>Some of those big boat amenities available in the cockpit include a wet bar, grill, and designated liferaft storage.

Most controls are well within reach from the helm, including single-line reefing, so the boat could easily be sailed by two people even if one of them wasn’t particularly handy. If that’s the case, the self-tacker is going to pay dividends, but several headsails are available, including a genoa, gennaker, and crossover.

It was my first position as mate and also my first time working with cargo. I had just come from working on a beautiful sailing yacht, and upon arrival I was appalled—by the safety standards, the under-maintained condition of the boat, but most of all by my anxiety levels over my new responsibilities. I was learning cargo operations on the run, learning a new boat, and learning to manage a crew that was made up of Kiribati men with varying levels of English proficiency, all of whom knew both the boat and cargo game better than I did. As we loaded cargo in Hawaii preparing for what was called Voyage 52, I was thrilled for the upcoming adventure—and mildly nauseated by my own inadequacies. And yes; I kept a journal.</p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjExOTgwMjY4ODQ2Nzg2MDgz/02-img_5714.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"1060\">\n                        <figcaption>The Kwai rests offshore at Tabuaran (Fanning Island) as crewmember Frank looks on.<p>Photo by Shanan Wolfe</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p><em><strong>2/11/2020</strong></em></p><p><em>Two days of sustained 20+ knot wind has built up the sea state, and the ocean washes over the boat as well as surrounds it.

Originally a German fishing boat built in 1950, she was bought by Brad Ives in the early 2000s and brought to Hawaii, where he outfitted her with a ketch rig and started a cargo business. The progeny of a long line of New England sea captains, including a direct descendant of Nathaniel Bowditch, Brad had been sailing the Pacific for a number of years already. With her cargo of first-world goods that are extremely difficult to come by on remote Pacific islands, <em>Kwai</em> by 2020 had become an important link with the global world for the Kiribati Line Islands. Not only was <em>Kwai </em>their main importer of everything except bulk food items like rice and flour, she employed a rotating pool of Kiribati men as deck crew. It was considered a great job for them, well-paying and with the benefit of trips to Hawaii for shopping. Conversely, by employing Kiribati as deck crew, the ship kept its own costs down and strengthened ties and loyalty with the people it served. The officers—captain, mate, engineer, supercargo and chef—were all assorted westerners.

And by men—we show up at the sand-floor, palm-frond-thatched-roof, wall-less “bar” and I look around at the eight or so tables of a dozen men each—not a woman as far as the eye can see. It was a good moment, standing there with my toes in the sand wondering the extent of the cultural faux pas I was making. I was brought a coconut, and endless baby cups of kava; was whupped resoundingly at pool, and declined singing on the excuse that I didn’t know the words to “Have You Ever Seen the Rain.” I slept ashore that night at a “hotel”—my five Australian dollars got me a palm-frond-enclosed platform in the front of Kabi’s cousin’s aunt’s brother’s fiancé’s yard.

My self-appointed position was catching and receiving painters, signaling the crane operator, and keeping both cargo and empty hook under some sort of control as it went from </em>Kwai<em> to bobbing small boats and back.

Environmental concerns are making the idea of a globalized world run on sustainable energy more and more attractive, and as sailors we are well aware of the power of the wind. Initiatives to reintroduce sustainable shipping are making a comeback, examples being Sail Cargo Inc. in Costa Rica, Schooner <em>Apollonia </em>on the Hudson River, and Fairtransport’s <em>The Tres Hombres </em>out of the Netherlands. As sailing is neither particularly fast nor particularly lauded when trying to stick to a schedule, it is hard to make these initiatives competitive with standard shipping, especially when sailing boats—even those with large cargo holds—can carry a fraction of what container ships can. Brad Ives was savvy enough to find a niche for the <em>Kwai</em> where her route took her across the trades in both directions, and she was truly important to the communities she served. </p><p><em><strong>3/15/2020</strong></em></p><p><em>We arrived back in Honolulu at the close of Voyage 52, battered, salty, and limping slightly with our three torn sails after our dogged fight to get north from Fanning Island. The wind kept increasing and turning more north on us, and we had to pinch the whole way to end up in Hawaii and not Siberia. The last day about summed up Voyage 52—10 miles away from beautiful, sheltered Oahu, the island a coy mirage playing peek-a-boo from behind rainstorms while loftily refusing to come closer with anything resembling alacrity or even reasonable quickness, we fought our way into a headwind gusting sometimes 50 knots, our speed a sad and grueling 3. And then a jib sheet block exploded, adding a torn-up jib clew to our list of repairs…</em></p><p><em>And the week since in Hawaii has flown past, filled with loading, repairs, and what personal time could be snatched for internet and shopping. We took the mizzen sail and the jib off and brought them over to the warehouse where they made the acquaintance of the ancient and industrial sewing machine. Myself, Iakobwa, Ieie, and Frank spent two days wrestling massive areas of canvas through the small runway of the sewing machine, the unstoppable forward march of the needle stemmed depressingly often because we couldn’t get our thread tension right and it kept breaking. Meanwhile, back on board our resident welder, Kabi, set to work on some deck projects—freeing the rust-frozen freeing ports, fixing small holes, and replacing tangs along the deck rail. Banu and Arioka replaced</em> <em>halyards and blocks, Captain Anika found time to replace the shattered window in the wheelhouse, Cook Jane rushed about buying massive food orders for us and for customers, Supercargo Chantale did lots of mysterious and important paperwork, Engineer Willy replaced steering tubes, machined an aluminum main clew reinforcement, and did oil changes. It was a busy few days, culminating yesterday morning in replacing the slewing gear (steel cables that help control the cargo boom) and finishing minutes before we cast off to to sail south and begin Voyage 53. Willy barely made it back on board after last minute shopping for outboard spares. Meanwhile, Honolulu is buzzing with talk of some rampant virus…</em></p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjExOTgwMjY4ODQ2ODUyMDcy/04-p1030690.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"1065\">\n                        <figcaption>On some islands, goods had to be transported to and from the shore via small boat.<p>Photo by Shanan Wolfe</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>While <em>Kwai</em>’s Voyage 52 was marked by extremely difficult conditions, equipment failures, and a breakneck schedule (and for me, personally, learning the ropes at top speed), Voyage 53 became its own kind of odyssey, as we swapped tidbits gleaned from emails about the degenerating state of a world descending into what was turning out to be a global pandemic, and endlessly discussed how we should react. The original plan was to service the Kiribati Islands and then continue past to the Cook Islands; however, the Cook Islands was one of the first countries to shut its borders down. As we revised our plans, moving between the virus-free Kiribati Islands and continuing to do cargo ops while receiving hundred-character emails from families stuck in a post-apocalyptic lockdown world, the “normalcy” of the world we had left behind increasingly lost its meaning. </p><p><em><strong>4/3/2020</strong></em></p><p><em>We are underway to Fanning. I just got off watch. It is a moonless night, but the stars are happy for it. There was singing on the aft deck earlier, but now all I hear is the occasional crying of a passenger’s baby forward, and the shush of the waves. </em></p><p><em>The world is a very weird place right now, I think. And weirder still, my assumptions of it, my experience of it, is all through gossip traded among the crew from the emails we’ve gotten from family and others. We are affected in that our schedule keeps changing. As borders are shutting, the day-to-day reality of being on a cargo boat in the middle of the Pacific stays the same, but our destinations change, and decisions as to whether or not to stay on the ship and continue to weather this changing schedule, or catch what might be the last flight (to Hawaii…and from there home or…elsewhere? Anywhere?) are looming. It is a hard decision, because as I said…I don’t really know the reality in the States right now. In Europe. Pretty much everywhere and anywhere else in this very impacted, very globalized world. Hearsay, and rumors, and emails, and headlines. What’s happening out there? Do I want to know? Do I want to go back? </em></p><p><em>Meanwhile my reality. The reality of sunrises and sunsets over tropical islands and endless horizons, the reality of the constant noise and music and laughter and singing of Kiribati culture, the reality of being so filthy at the end of each day I take my clothes into the shower with me to rinse them out. The reality of a cabin that is so hot that my chocolate stash is a melted ruin. The reality of rain showers and millions of stars. The reality of waking up each morning and being ready to spend the next 12 hours creating order out of chaos as myself and 8 to 12 Kiribati guys with varying English play Tetris loading and unloading the ship of everything from USB cards to 40 tons of copra (dried coconut) to 300 drums of petrol to diapers. Flour. Soda. Car batteries. Oh, but make sure the lumber is accessible for Fanning but the water tanks have to be lashed but the totes can’t be under the copra and we need to access under the foc’sle for when we get to Christmas but THOSE DRUMS CANT GO THERE THE PLYWOOD HAS TO BE ACCESSIBLE passengers coming in 10 make sure the tarps are up USE A STERN LINE you to the foc’sle please make sure everything’s lashed NO not those bikes those are Washington Island BOOM UP BOOM UP this water tank needs to be turned so we can fit those two pallets here but that clothing bale needs to be accessible tomorrow move it first DOWN DOWN DOWN when you have a sec change the top block on the mizzen lazy jacks USE A HOT KNIFE great how’s everyone doing OK breathe.

The reality of managing chaos, or playing stresstris, as I’ve started calling it. I’m learning a ton, and I think I’m getting better. </em></p><p><em>The reality of dolphins breathing around the boat at night.</em></p><p>Not only would the <em>Kwai </em>transport cargo from Hawaii down to the Kiribati Islands, she would typically transport cargo between the three islands. After arriving in Christmas Island, we would unload the portion of the hold delegated to that island, and then load that space back up with staples such as rice and flour. Container ships would stop at Christmas, but <em>Kwai</em> was the ship that distributed these goods on to the more remote Fanning and Washington. As we unloaded and created space in the hold at Fanning and Washington, we would take on copra—Kiribati’s main export. We would also take human passengers between the islands. Passengers were messy, chaotic, heartwarming, and stressful.</p><p><em><strong>4/10/2020</strong></em></p><p><em>I love the music. Everyone here sings, everyone. It is the go-to social activity. Karaoke at the bar, music while they work, grab a guitar or a ukulele on a work break or a cava night and everyone will join in, filling the bass parts, altos, leads, tenors, and harmonies. I love to sing and love being in a culture where it is enjoyed and appreciated when I do—and better yet, I can sing songs they don’t know the words to—and they don’t know that I don’t, either!</em></p><p><em>They worry here that they will run out of food. They rely on the staples being brought to Christmas Island by cargo ship but are terrified of a ship bringing the virus—they would have no defense. There are fish and coconuts, but not at a level to support the current populations. While the rest of the world panics about the stock market and toilet paper, here they worry about running out of food. And once </em>Kwai <em>leaves for Hawaii, she will not be allowed back. That means that whichever of the crew come with us for the trip north will not be allowed back home for the foreseeable future. A hard choice. The guys need money, but they don’t want to be willingly separated from their families.</em></p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjExOTgwMjY4ODQ2ODUxNjE5/05-786c34f7-a690-4c77-a213-c947f3e721b5.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"800\">\n                        <figcaption>Shanan takes a selfie with the swimming kids at Teraina (Washington Island) before catching a ride back to the ship with unsold “Kwai Store” goods, stored in the black totes for the journey.<p>Photo by Shanan Wolfe</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p><em>And for me. I need to figure out if I’m staying on the boat or trying to catch what might be the last flight back to civilization. The world out there sounds like a crazy place. </em></p><p><em>I had a couple hours’ breathing time this afternoon and was given leave to go to shore—first time I’d set foot on Washington Island. It’s INCREDIBLE. Green grasses in the clearings under arcing coconut palms, separated from the blue water by a snaking ribbon of white sand. The palms were so dense in places it was almost dark under them, their roots drinking from canals of brackish water that reflect the sky. Washington has a freshwater lake at the center, someone told me the only Pacific atoll to do so. A bumpy dirt two-track runs along the inside of the tree line parallel the beach, and as I walked along, Kiribati on bikes or motorcycles would ride past, usually two to a motorbike, and we smile at each other and say “Mouri!” Back at the loading spot 30 kids were playing semi-naked in the water. They all came running when I pointed my camera at them, and then climbed aboard my boat when I caught a lift back to the ship. I teased them that they were strong and would help us unload, and then had to deal with getting a riot of eager flexing children off the </em>Kwai<em>. Ooops! It was beautiful.</em></p><p>Mid April of 2020 <em>Kwai </em>sailed north back to Hawaii. Of the five Kiribati crew who were supposed to sail north, on the morning of our departure from Christmas Island one showed up at the boat ashen-faced, announcing he could not leave his family. It was an impossible decision in a world filled with impossible decisions, and was respected. The rest of us, including the four Kiribati who did come, sailed north to Hawaii where I also left the boat to be with my family. </p><p><em>Kwai </em>continued on in the next months doing ocean clean up, using her crane and cargo hold to pick ghost nets out of the great Pacific garbage patch. In 2021 she was sold to the Marshall Islands, where she continues to be used as an environmentally friendly transport ship, helping to meet the Marshall Islands’ target of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. </p><p>Sailing with <em>Kwai </em>in the early months of 2020 was one of the most surreal and vivid chapters of my life. Not only because the world was changing, and I was living it through an experience of cargo ops on flat, improbable, coconut-covered islands in the middle of the Pacific. It was also a time when I was surrounded by another culture during global turbulence, and not as a tourist or a visitor, but as someone who worked and sweated and sang every minute of every day alongside them while we breathed life into the common purpose that was the ship. Covid upended the world. But in the three short months I sailed and worked in the insular, semi-controlled chaos that was <em>Kwai</em>, the ship kept my world whole. </p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjExODU3MjEzNDcwMjg3ODQ4/11nov-12dec-subscribe-02.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"1195\">\n                        \n                    </figure>\n                    <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/48VZMQU\">Click Here to Subscribe</a></p><p>January/February 2025</p>",

Where we floated just offshore for two days because the anchor wouldn’t hold in the coral, while small boats ran the cargo to and from the beach, our crane guy skillfully lifting drums of oil and pallets of cargo from the moving ship to the bouncing small boats alongside without smashing cargo or people. My self-appointed position was catching and receiving painters, signaling the crane operator, and keeping both cargo and empty hook under some sort of control as it went from Kwai to bobbing small boats and back. Absolute chaos, but…these guys are good. And safety standards are nonexistent.  \n\n                        \n                        \n                        Engineer Willy and crew Banu share a sunset during the passage south. \nPhoto by Shanan Wolfe\n\n                    \n                    \nWhile a novel occurrence in the 21st century, Sail Cargo is not unique to the Kwai. Environmental concerns are making the idea of a globalized world run on sustainable energy more and more attractive, and as sailors we are well aware of the power of the wind. Initiatives to reintroduce sustainable shipping are making a comeback, examples being Sail Cargo Inc. in Costa Rica, Schooner Apollonia on the Hudson River, and Fairtransport’s The Tres Hombres out of the Netherlands. As sailing is neither particularly fast nor particularly lauded when trying to stick to a schedule, it is hard to make these initiatives competitive with standard shipping, especially when sailing boats—even those with large cargo holds—can carry a fraction of what container ships can. Brad Ives was savvy enough to find a niche for the Kwai where her route took her across the trades in both directions, and she was truly important to the communities she served. \n3/15/2020\nWe arrived back in Honolulu at the close of Voyage 52, battered, salty, and limping slightly with our three torn sails after our dogged fight to get north from Fanning Island. The wind kept increasing and turning more north on us, and we had to pinch the whole way to end up in Hawaii and not Siberia. The last day about summed up Voyage 52—10 miles away from beautiful, sheltered Oahu, the island a coy mirage playing peek-a-boo from behind rainstorms while loftily refusing to come closer with anything resembling alacrity or even reasonable quickness, we fought our way into a headwind gusting sometimes 50 knots, our speed a sad and grueling 3. And then a jib sheet block exploded, adding a torn-up jib clew to our list of repairs…\nAnd the week since in Hawaii has flown past, filled with loading, repairs, and what personal time could be snatched for internet and shopping. We took the mizzen sail and the jib off and brought them over to the warehouse where they made the acquaintance of the ancient and industrial sewing machine. Myself, Iakobwa, Ieie, and Frank spent two days wrestling massive areas of canvas through the small runway of the sewing machine, the unstoppable forward march of the needle stemmed depressingly often because we couldn’t get our thread tension right and it kept breaking. Meanwhile, back on board our resident welder, Kabi, set to work on some deck projects—freeing the rust-frozen freeing ports, fixing small holes, and replacing tangs along the deck rail. Banu and Arioka replaced halyards and blocks, Captain Anika found time to replace the shattered window in the wheelhouse, Cook Jane rushed about buying massive food orders for us and for customers, Supercargo Chantale did lots of mysterious and important paperwork, Engineer Willy replaced steering tubes, machined an aluminum main clew reinforcement, and did oil changes. It was a busy few days, culminating yesterday morning in replacing the slewing gear (steel cables that help control the cargo boom) and finishing minutes before we cast off to to sail south and begin Voyage 53. Willy barely made it back on board after last minute shopping for outboard spares. Meanwhile, Honolulu is buzzing with talk of some rampant virus…\n\n                        \n                        \n                        On some islands, goods had to be transported to and from the shore via small boat.\nPhoto by Shanan Wolfe\n\n                    \n                    \nWhile Kwai’s Voyage 52 was marked by extremely difficult conditions, equipment failures, and a breakneck schedule (and for me, personally, learning the ropes at top speed), Voyage 53 became its own kind of odyssey, as we swapped tidbits gleaned from emails about the degenerating state of a world descending into what was turning out to be a global pandemic, and endlessly discussed how we should react. The original plan was to service the Kiribati Islands and then continue past to the Cook Islands; however, the Cook Islands was one of the first countries to shut its borders down. As we revised our plans, moving between the virus-free Kiribati Islands and continuing to do cargo ops while receiving hundred-character emails from families stuck in a post-apocalyptic lockdown world, the “normalcy” of the world we had left behind increasingly lost its meaning. \n4/3/2020\nWe are underway to Fanning. I just got off watch. It is a moonless night, but the stars are happy for it. There was singing on the aft deck earlier, but now all I hear is the occasional crying of a passenger’s baby forward, and the shush of the waves. \nThe world is a very weird place right now, I think. And weirder still, my assumptions of it, my experience of it, is all through gossip traded among the crew from the emails we’ve gotten from family and others. We are affected in that our schedule keeps changing. As borders are shutting, the day-to-day reality of being on a cargo boat in the middle of the Pacific stays the same, but our destinations change, and decisions as to whether or not to stay on the ship and continue to weather this changing schedule, or catch what might be the last flight (to Hawaii…and from there home or…elsewhere? Anywhere?) are looming. It is a hard decision, because as I said…I don’t really know the reality in the States right now. In Europe. Pretty much everywhere and anywhere else in this very impacted, very globalized world. Hearsay, and rumors, and emails, and headlines. What’s happening out there? Do I want to know? Do I want to go back? \nMeanwhile my reality. The reality of sunrises and sunsets over tropical islands and endless horizons, the reality of the constant noise and music and laughter and singing of Kiribati culture, the reality of being so filthy at the end of each day I take my clothes into the shower with me to rinse them out. The reality of a cabin that is so hot that my chocolate stash is a melted ruin. The reality of rain showers and millions of stars. The reality of waking up each morning and being ready to spend the next 12 hours creating order out of chaos as myself and 8 to 12 Kiribati guys with varying English play Tetris loading and unloading the ship of everything from USB cards to 40 tons of copra (dried coconut) to 300 drums of petrol to diapers. Flour. Soda. Car batteries. Oh, but make sure the lumber is accessible for Fanning but the water tanks have to be lashed but the totes can’t be under the copra and we need to access under the foc’sle for when we get to Christmas but THOSE DRUMS CANT GO THERE THE PLYWOOD HAS TO BE ACCESSIBLE passengers coming in 10 make sure the tarps are up USE A STERN LINE you to the foc’sle please make sure everything’s lashed NO not those bikes those are Washington Island BOOM UP BOOM UP this water tank needs to be turned so we can fit those two pallets here but that clothing bale needs to be accessible tomorrow move it first DOWN DOWN DOWN when you have a sec change the top block on the mizzen lazy jacks USE A HOT KNIFE great how’s everyone doing OK breathe. Breathe. Chug another full water bottle. Laugh. Tease the guys. Back to work.\n\n                        \n                        \n                        Unloading deck level cargo at Tabuaran (Fanning Island), the only way to access the goods in the hold.\nPhoto by Shanan Wolfe\n\n                    \n                    \nThey know the game and I’m learning the game and quite often Anika, the captain, steps in if I’m flustered and overwhelmed but still…It’s a lot. The reality of managing chaos, or playing stresstris, as I’ve started calling it. I’m learning a ton, and I think I’m getting better. \nThe reality of dolphins breathing around the boat at night.\nNot only would the Kwai transport cargo from Hawaii down to the Kiribati Islands, she would typically transport cargo between the three islands. After arriving in Christmas Island, we would unload the portion of the hold delegated to that island, and then load that space back up with staples such as rice and flour. Container ships would stop at Christmas, but Kwai was the ship that distributed these goods on to the more remote Fanning and Washington. As we unloaded and created space in the hold at Fanning and Washington, we would take on copra—Kiribati’s main export. We would also take human passengers between the islands. Passengers were messy, chaotic, heartwarming, and stressful.\n4/10/2020\nI love the music. Everyone here sings, everyone. It is the go-to social activity. Karaoke at the bar, music while they work, grab a guitar or a ukulele on a work break or a cava night and everyone will join in, filling the bass parts, altos, leads, tenors, and harmonies. I love to sing and love being in a culture where it is enjoyed and appreciated when I do—and better yet, I can sing songs they don’t know the words to—and they don’t know that I don’t, either!\nThey worry here that they will run out of food. They rely on the staples being brought to Christmas Island by cargo ship but are terrified of a ship bringing the virus—they would have no defense. There are fish and coconuts, but not at a level to support the current populations. While the rest of the world panics about the stock market and toilet paper, here they worry about running out of food. And once Kwai leaves for Hawaii, she will not be allowed back. That means that whichever of the crew come with us for the trip north will not be allowed back home for the foreseeable future. A hard choice. The guys need money, but they don’t want to be willingly separated from their families.\n\n                        \n                        \n                        Shanan takes a selfie with the swimming kids at Teraina (Washington Island) before catching a ride back to the ship with unsold “Kwai Store” goods, stored in the black totes for the journey.\nPhoto by Shanan Wolfe\n\n                    \n                    \nAnd for me. I need to figure out if I’m staying on the boat or trying to catch what might be the last flight back to civilization. The world out there sounds like a crazy place. \nI had a couple hours’ breathing time this afternoon and was given leave to go to shore—first time I’d set foot on Washington Island. It’s INCREDIBLE. Green grasses in the clearings under arcing coconut palms, separated from the blue water by a snaking ribbon of white sand. The palms were so dense in places it was almost dark under them, their roots drinking from canals of brackish water that reflect the sky. Washington has a freshwater lake at the center, someone told me the only Pacific atoll to do so. A bumpy dirt two-track runs along the inside of the tree line parallel the beach, and as I walked along, Kiribati on bikes or motorcycles would ride past, usually two to a motorbike, and we smile at each other and say “Mouri!” Back at the loading spot 30 kids were playing semi-naked in the water. They all came running when I pointed my camera at them, and then climbed aboard my boat when I caught a lift back to the ship. I teased them that they were strong and would help us unload, and then had to deal with getting a riot of eager flexing children off the Kwai. Ooops! It was beautiful.\nMid April of 2020 Kwai sailed north back to Hawaii. Of the five Kiribati crew who were supposed to sail north, on the morning of our departure from Christmas Island one showed up at the boat ashen-faced, announcing he could not leave his family. It was an impossible decision in a world filled with impossible decisions, and was respected. The rest of us, including the four Kiribati who did come, sailed north to Hawaii where I also left the boat to be with my family. \nKwai continued on in the next months doing ocean clean up, using her crane and cargo hold to pick ghost nets out of the great Pacific garbage patch. In 2021 she was sold to the Marshall Islands, where she continues to be used as an environmentally friendly transport ship, helping to meet the Marshall Islands’ target of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. \nSailing with Kwai in the early months of 2020 was one of the most surreal and vivid chapters of my life. Not only because the world was changing, and I was living it through an experience of cargo ops on flat, improbable, coconut-covered islands in the middle of the Pacific. It was also a time when I was surrounded by another culture during global turbulence, and not as a tourist or a visitor, but as someone who worked and sweated and sang every minute of every day alongside them while we breathed life into the common purpose that was the ship. Covid upended the world. But in the three short months I sailed and worked in the insular, semi-controlled chaos that was Kwai, the ship kept my world whole. \n\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \nClick Here to Subscribe\nJanuary/February 2025",

    "content:encoded": "<p>Do you remember the moment you got hooked on sailing? Jumping behind the helm of the new J/40 brought all of that rushing back for me. This new design is beautifully balanced and responds to even the subtlest changes in the wind. Like many J/Boat designs before her, she is a true racer/cruiser.</p><iframe width=\"320\" height=\"560\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TLAPYYYxjlA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Not to be confused with the classic J/40, built between 1984 and 1994, this new design, launched in 2024, aims to push the envelope as an offshore worthy, high performance cruising yacht capable of double-digit speeds. While the breeze never even hit double digits the day we sailed, I have no doubt she would accelerate well into her promised performance range off the wind.  </p><p>I joined the first sail of hull No. 1 in the U.S., just before the Annapolis Sailboat Show last October. The boat had arrived from production days earlier and the Incidence sails were bent on the night before. Jeff Johnstone joined us onboard and was as excited as we were to put the new J/40 design through her paces. With light to moderate air in the forecast, there was no hesitation loading a large A2 spinnaker onboard. </p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjExOTc4OTAwNjMxMzMyODQw/04-sequence-0100_00_09_15still001.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"861\">\n                        <figcaption>A centerline table can be installed for cruise mode and removed for race mode.<p>Photo by Wendy Mitman Clarke</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>I nearly walked right past this new boat on the docks, because its twin wheels aren’t the typical large, single wheel I’d seen on nearly every other J/Boat I’d ever sailed on or raced against. This arrangement is a direct lineage from the boat’s older sister, the J/45 (<a href=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/boats/top-10-best-boats-review-j-45\">a Top 10 Best Boats winner in 2023</a>), with which she shares many similarities.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Do you remember the moment you got hooked on sailing? Jumping behind the helm of the new J/40 brought all of that rushing back for me. This new design is beautifully balanced and responds to even the subtlest changes in the wind. Like many J/Boat designs before her, she is a true racer/cruiser.\n\nNot to be confused with the classic J/40, built between 1984 and 1994, this new design, launched in 2024, aims to push the envelope as an offshore worthy, high performance cruising yacht capable of double-digit speeds. While the breeze never even hit double digits the day we sailed, I have no doubt she would accelerate well into her promised performance range off the wind.  \nI joined the first sail of hull No. 1 in the U.S., just before the Annapolis Sailboat Show last October. The boat had arrived from production days earlier and the Incidence sails were bent on the night before. Jeff Johnstone joined us onboard and was as excited as we were to put the new J/40 design through her paces. With light to moderate air in the forecast, there was no hesitation loading a large A2 spinnaker onboard. \n\n                        \n                        \n                        A centerline table can be installed for cruise mode and removed for race mode.\nPhoto by Wendy Mitman Clarke\n\n                    \n                    \nI nearly walked right past this new boat on the docks, because its twin wheels aren’t the typical large, single wheel I’d seen on nearly every other J/Boat I’d ever sailed on or raced against. This arrangement is a direct lineage from the boat’s older sister, the J/45 (a Top 10 Best Boats winner in 2023), with which she shares many similarities. In profile, the boat has adopted the plumb bow, fixed sprit, and low-slung deckhouse common to many performance-oriented production boats we see now. But the similarities end with a subtle sheer, a smooth, chineless run aft, and a 63-foot carbon spar as standard.  \nIt was an easy step from the dock to the drop-down transom swim platform (optional—standard is a low, fixed transom) and into the cockpit, with the adjustable hydraulic backstay providing a nice hand hold. For cockpit ergonomics, the twin helms mean clear fore and aft movement around a centerline table that’s easily removed for racing mode; they also mean better outboard steering options for the helmsperson and excellent visibility in all directions. \nJust aft of the companionway, a locker below the floor provides line tail storage while also satisfying current offshore racing standards and allowing for a lower companionway threshold, a smooth transition between the cockpit and cabin, and room for a self-storing companionway door. \n\n                        \n                        \n                        The interior nicely combines cruising comfort with seaworthy features.

    "content:encoded": "<p>A Frenchman once jabbed, “Why do you stupid Americans store your toilet waste under your bed on your boats?! That’s such a disgusting habit!”</p><p>Exactly what constitutes “disgusting” may vary among cultures, but his observation about plumbing systems within boats flying a U.S. flag is spot-on. Indeed, holding tank use is strictly an American preoccupation, and the infrastructure for pumping out waste tanks is virtually nonexistent outside the U.S. The majority of sailors from the rest of the world have no tank and instead pump their toilet waste directly overboard. As an American, I think our habits around holding tank use, and the regulations and pump-out systems that support those habits, are something to be proud of and emulated, not ridiculed.</p><p>That said, my French friend has a point. Holding tanks are, by nature, pretty gross and often the source of bad boat smells. To keep your boat smelling fresh—and to ensure your good environmental stewardship practices don’t turn the insides of your boat into a hazmat zone—you need to adhere to an effective tank care routine and build your marine sanitation systems out of the best possible supplies. </p><p>To monitor the situation, let your nose be the judge. Unwanted odors can be addressed by evaluating the following possible causes:</p><p><strong>Stagnant seawater.</strong> When a seawater toilet hasn’t been used in a few days, it will produce a pungent odor when it is first flushed again. It’s helpful to know why. About a gallon of seawater fills the hose between the intake seacock and the bowl. When that water sits for several days, all the microorganisms that live in that seawater die. Their microscopic little corpses then rot, and that rot is what you smell coming from the toilet bowl when you flush. Somehow, it’s comforting to know that the smell is from dead seawater and has nothing at all to do with human waste. If you flush your toilet at least once a day, the water doesn’t have time to stagnate and won’t produce any odor. If the boat sits unused for a few days, the stinky water will be removed from the boat after the first flush.</p><p>A simple psychological trick can be a remarkably effective solution for addressing this particular odor: Now that you know what the smell is, try to associate it with happy thoughts about the beach and oysters. Suddenly the smell is a welcome natural perfume of summer and not something to make you grimace in disgust. If you can’t make the mental gymnastics work, another way to mitigate the stale seawater smell is to add a splash of holding tank deodorant to the first flush after the boat has been sitting for a few days. As a bonus, this dose of deodorant will advance down the hose to fight odor in the tank.</p><p>Switching to a freshwater toilet will solve the stagnant seawater smell problem completely. Unfortunately, this choice comes with significant downsides. It feels wasteful to tap into your limited supply of freshwater to flush a toilet while surrounded by an infinite supply of seawater that could do the job just as well. Freshwater toilets are more complicated than seawater toilets, and as such are more prone to breakdowns. Freshwater toilets use more precious battery power than seawater toilets. Lastly, if a back-flow preventer valve fails, it is possible that wastewater from a freshwater toilet can migrate backwards and contaminate your freshwater supply in the water tank—not something you want to think about when making lemonade or brushing teeth. All factors considered, I believe it is smart to stick with seawater flush for all onboard toilets.</p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjEyMTE4NDQwNjI5MDUyOTYz/06-img_1009-4.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"983\">\n                        <figcaption>Wear and tear on your plumbing can be a culprit for bad smells.<p>Photo&colon; Christopher Birch</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p><strong>Smelly waste in the tank.</strong> Frequent pump-outs coupled with copious use of holding tank deodorant is the solution here.

As you might imagine, that air smells bad. The vent hose exhausts outside the boat, but on a calm day, or with the wind blowing from the wrong direction, that fetid air can linger around the boat something fierce. The solution here is a holding tank vent filter. Hopefully the boatbuilder included one of these filters when they built your boat. If not, adding one can be a relatively easy DIY project. You simply cut the ¾-inch holding tank vent hose at an opportune location and install an inline vent filter with a pair of hose clamps. If access to the vent hose is good, this project is easy. If access is poor, the project gets harder.</p><p>Tank vents (with or without filters) will clog with sewage if the tank is overfilled. A clogged vent will make it impossible to flush anything in regardless of the waste level in the tank. To remedy this situation, clear the clog and change the filter.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "A Frenchman once jabbed, “Why do you stupid Americans store your toilet waste under your bed on your boats?! That’s such a disgusting habit!”\nExactly what constitutes “disgusting” may vary among cultures, but his observation about plumbing systems within boats flying a U.S. flag is spot-on. Indeed, holding tank use is strictly an American preoccupation, and the infrastructure for pumping out waste tanks is virtually nonexistent outside the U.S. The majority of sailors from the rest of the world have no tank and instead pump their toilet waste directly overboard. As an American, I think our habits around holding tank use, and the regulations and pump-out systems that support those habits, are something to be proud of and emulated, not ridiculed.\nThat said, my French friend has a point.

    "content:encoded": "<p>If you missed Boat Shopping Part 1, <a href=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/cruising/boat-shopping-part-1\">read it here</a>. </p><p>If the worst part about buying a boat, as my friend and business partner August Sandberg says, is that the search is over, then surely the best part is the excitement of having found the right boat.</p><p>Last issue I teased the fact that I thought Mia and I had found it, a 1971 Olle Enderlein 36 lovingly restored in Sweden.</p><p>I didn’t have a specific model, designer, or even era in mind when we started shopping. We were looking for a boat between 34-36 feet that would fit in the winter shed we own at our local sailing club and that would be a “value” deal. We wanted a used boat that had been properly refit, “from the inside out,” as Mia put it, not just cosmetically. An older or lesser-known boat that was undervalued despite its condition, just because the market was smaller. Our would-be new boat needed to have a pedigreed designer; solid construction techniques (absolutely no balsa in the hull or deck, but Divinycell foam was OK); a rebuilt, modern electrical system; and renovated essentials like steering gear, rudder bearings, and all the important stuff.</p><p>The OE36 I stumbled upon through the blocket.se search algorithm seemed to fit that bill, almost too perfectly, so Mia and I had to see it. I went first, driving two-and-a-half hours to the southern part of the Stockholm Archipelago to see the boat in the water. This was a private listing, no brokers involved, which made for a peaceful, no-pressure first encounter with the boat.</p><p>The seller, Martin, knew us from 59º North, had been a fan of my <em>On the Wind</em> podcast for years, and was excited about the idea of the boat going to knowledgeable people like us. He was selling after 10 years of ownership because of a career change. While he initially had visions of taking the OE36 around the world, his life had evolved in unexpected ways, and he’d taken a job several hours north, so boat ownership wasn’t in the cards. </p><p>He’d bought the boat from the folks who’d restored her in the mid-2000s. A nearby boatbuilder, who for decades had built the interiors of the revered Najad line of Swedish sailboats, completed the renovation. They had rebuilt the interior in beautiful satin-varnished mahogany and oak, replaced the teak deck after fixing fiberglass issues in various places, rebuilt and zeroed out the the late 1990s Perkins engine, and finished a host of other projects big and small.</p><p>When I first saw the boat, I couldn’t contain my excitement. I think I first video-called Adam Browne, our bosun at 59º North. </p><p>“Adam, you won’t believe this!” I exclaimed. “There’s dust in the bilge! The inside of the lockers are lined with cedar! The engine is spotless!

    "content:encodedSnippet": "If you missed Boat Shopping Part 1, read it here. \nIf the worst part about buying a boat, as my friend and business partner August Sandberg says, is that the search is over, then surely the best part is the excitement of having found the right boat.\nLast issue I teased the fact that I thought Mia and I had found it, a 1971 Olle Enderlein 36 lovingly restored in Sweden.\nI didn’t have a specific model, designer, or even era in mind when we started shopping. We were looking for a boat between 34-36 feet that would fit in the winter shed we own at our local sailing club and that would be a “value” deal. We wanted a used boat that had been properly refit, “from the inside out,” as Mia put it, not just cosmetically. An older or lesser-known boat that was undervalued despite its condition, just because the market was smaller. Our would-be new boat needed to have a pedigreed designer; solid construction techniques (absolutely no balsa in the hull or deck, but Divinycell foam was OK); a rebuilt, modern electrical system; and renovated essentials like steering gear, rudder bearings, and all the important stuff.\nThe OE36 I stumbled upon through the blocket.se search algorithm seemed to fit that bill, almost too perfectly, so Mia and I had to see it. I went first, driving two-and-a-half hours to the southern part of the Stockholm Archipelago to see the boat in the water. This was a private listing, no brokers involved, which made for a peaceful, no-pressure first encounter with the boat.\nThe seller, Martin, knew us from 59º North, had been a fan of my On the Wind podcast for years, and was excited about the idea of the boat going to knowledgeable people like us. He was selling after 10 years of ownership because of a career change. While he initially had visions of taking the OE36 around the world, his life had evolved in unexpected ways, and he’d taken a job several hours north, so boat ownership wasn’t in the cards. \nHe’d bought the boat from the folks who’d restored her in the mid-2000s. A nearby boatbuilder, who for decades had built the interiors of the revered Najad line of Swedish sailboats, completed the renovation. They had rebuilt the interior in beautiful satin-varnished mahogany and oak, replaced the teak deck after fixing fiberglass issues in various places, rebuilt and zeroed out the the late 1990s Perkins engine, and finished a host of other projects big and small.\nWhen I first saw the boat, I couldn’t contain my excitement. I think I first video-called Adam Browne, our bosun at 59º North. \n“Adam, you won’t believe this!” I exclaimed. “There’s dust in the bilge! The inside of the lockers are lined with cedar! The engine is spotless! And look at that electrical panel!”\nI’ve looked at a lot of boats over the past 20 years and I’d never seen an old boat look so new. “This is definitely it,” I said to Mia on the car ride home that day.\nA week later we drove down together to meet Martin in person and go for a short trial sail. Mia needed to see the boat for herself. She is absolutely the more tempered member of our family emotionally, but even she was taken aback.

A good helmsman will drive to the telltales on the luff, aiming for them to be flowing aft (or slightly lifted in heavy air). If the windward telltales begin to flutter, she will head down. If the leeward telltales stall, there is room to head up. In puffy conditions, a headsail can be feathered (partially luffed) to keep the boat at proper heel in gusts. Here’s how to dial in that sail:</p><p><strong>Headstay:</strong> Headstay sag is generally controlled by the backstay. For boats with no backstay, shroud tension is the best influence but challenging to adjust underway. More headstay sag (less backstay pressure), creates a fuller, more powerful shape. For lighter air, keep the backstay looser. As the wind increases, slowly add tension, maxing out by the mid to upper teens. </p><p><strong>Halyard:</strong> Halyard tension moves the sail’s draft (or point of maximum depth) forward, creating a more rounded entry. Result: a wider steering groove and less heel, ideal in windy and wavy conditions. Lighter air and smoother water require less halyard tension. With the sail sheeted, look for horizontal wrinkles near the luff and add halyard tension until they just disappear. Halyard adjustments with the sheet eased are much easier. In very light air it is all right if wrinkles are just visible; keep in mind the halyard may be over tensioned and need to be eased. </p><p><strong>Car:</strong> The headsail car position affects the twist of the sail (the difference in angle to the wind between the top and bottom). Sliding the car aft puts more tension on the foot of the sail and less on the leech, opening the top of the sail. Moving the car forward, leech tension increases and foot tension decreases, closing off the top of the sail. </p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjEyMTE0NjU0MzQ2ODgxMDAw/0a8e7c02-12d9-47ce-8468-79b5bc564ed8.jpg\" height=\"258\" width=\"1200\">\n                        <figcaption>When the genoa’s windward telltales are fluttering up (left), it’s time to trim or fall off so that they begin to break less (middle) and finally flow evenly (right).&nbsp;<p>Photo&colon; Ryan Cove &commat;covephoto</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>Start with having the fully tensioned sheet run to the clew at about 45 degrees; adjust from there. Test by slowly heading up into the wind with the sail trimmed in. If all the windward telltales break at the same time, the car is well set. If the upper telltales break first, move the car forward. If the lower telltales break first, move the car aft. In a dying breeze, expect to progressively move the car forward. </p><p><strong>Sheet:</strong> The most important control. Let the boat accelerate before coming in all the way. If boatspeed drops because of wave action or a maneuver, ease the sheet and start over, trimming back in slowly. Tension varies with wind velocity. Light air may mean an overlapping headsail is a foot or so off the spreader. Heavy air may place it within an inch. You are trading power for pointing ability with sheet tension and the sweet spot will vary by boat and condition.  </p><p><strong>Leech and Foot Cords:</strong> Ease these to the point where the sail is fluttering and then tighten them up just enough to stop it.</p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjEyMTE0NjU0MzQ3MDEyMDcy/03-aunknown.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"955\">\n                        <figcaption>The car position on the genoa track can be used to open or close off the top of the headsail.<p>Photo&colon; Wendy Mitman Clarke</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <h2>Upwind: Mainsail</h2><p>The main drives balance and heel angle. Good main trim is essential for pointing well upwind.</p><p><strong>Halyard:</strong> Same concept as the headsail. More tension in heavy air and looser in light air. A cunningham (to pull down on the luff) creates the same effect. Look to remove wrinkles in the lower portion of the sail; a hint of them in light air is fine. </p><p><strong>Outhaul:</strong> Shaping the depth of the main’s lower portion, the outhaul can be eased or tensioned to adjust power. Keep it relatively tighter when sailing upwind for better lift characteristics and add further tension to reduce heel and weather helm. Lighter conditions call for easing to help maintain boat speed, but rarely more than a few inches of clew movement from full tension.  </p><p><strong>Backstay:</strong> Backstay tension depowers the upper portion of the main—that is, if the mast can bend much. Bending the mast stretches the sail between the luff and leech and flattens the sail. Slowly adding backstay pressure as the wind increases works well for both the headsail and main.  </p><p><strong>Mainsheet:</strong> As the mainsheet is tensioned, it first pulls the boom towards center, and then as the sheet becomes vertical, it mostly pulls down. This downward force on the leech controls twist. Sailing upwind in light to moderate air, the boom should be near centerline. Moderate twist, through less sheet tension, increases air flow—this is good for accelerating and light air (all the leech telltales should be flowing). As the boat gets up to speed, sheet in and decrease twist to increase the ability to point higher (the top telltale may show signs of stalling). In higher winds and puffs, the sheet can be eased to luff and depower. </p><p><strong>Traveler:</strong> The traveler controls the athwartships location of the boom without sacrificing twist. In light air, the traveler is above center, while the boom is on center with plenty of mainsail twist. As wind pressure increases, and the mainsheet is tensioned, and the traveler is eased to leeward. In gusty conditions, the traveler can be played to balance out the helm and heel of the boat. </p><p>No traveler? The best bet is to find a middle ground between twist and boom position. </p><p><strong>Vang:</strong> The vang provides leech tension when the mainsheet is unable to do so (mostly off the wind or in heavy air). This is a helpful tool, albeit still limited, for boats without travelers. For boats with travelers, hand snug in light to medium air and build tension as wind increases so the mainsheet can be quickly and largely eased in puffs while minimizing twist.</p><p><strong>Leech Cord:</strong> Same as the headsail.</p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjEyMTE0NjU0MzQ3MTQzMTQ0/04-img_0712.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"643\">\n                        <figcaption>This chute is perfectly trimmed. If the first panel starts to curl, it’s time to trim or head down.<p>Photo&colon; Ryan Cove &commat;covephoto</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <h2>Off the Wind</h2><p>As the apparent wind angle increases and velocity drops, ease control lines and the backstay to redefine sail shape and add power. In building breeze, these same lines can be used to depower and get the boat back on its feet.</p><p><strong>Headsail:</strong> Let the telltales drive the sheet and car position. Move the car forward to compensate for an eased sheet. An outboard track is helpful when reaching, but eventually maintaining proper leech tension isn’t possible. Then, focus on the middle telltales and accept that the bottom of the sail will be slightly over-trimmed, and the top will be twisted off. </p><p><strong>Mainsail:</strong> The mainsheet should be eased until the luff of the sail begins to form a bubble, then sheet back in until it just disappears. Never be afraid of easing to check for over-trimming. The vang will become the leading control for leech tension (twist); tension enough to keep the top batten roughly parallel to the boom, keeping the leech telltales fully flying. Like the headsail, ease the sheet in puffs to accelerate and adapt to the change in apparent wind. </p><p><strong>Spinnaker:</strong> Asymmetrical spinnakers come in different cuts and weights to handle varying apparent wind angles and velocities. With the appropriate sail flying, ease the sheet until the forward edge of the spinnaker begins to curl. Trim back in to fill the sail and so the first panel occasionally curls. Regularly ease the sheet to check for correct trim. For more stability, the sail can be slightly over trimmed. </p><p>The tack line should be eased when heading deeper to increase depth and allow more rotation. Tighten the tack line when reaching. There is a conditions-dependent limit as to how deep asymmetrical spinnakers can be carried (unless you shift to flying off a pole).  </p><p>With a symmetrical spinnaker, square the pole to be perpendicular to the wind and then trim the sheet as you would an asymmetrical spinnaker. The pole can be dropped lower when reaching and left perpendicular to the mast when running.</p><p>Spinnaker lead positions are typically static, but twings can be used to control the sheeting angle and apply more leech tension. These become especially helpful with low-clew sails like a code zero.</p><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p>Understanding sail trim lets us shift gears as the wind builds or drops. It breathes exciting new life into any boat. Maneuvers become easier, and reefing becomes just one of many depowering techniques. </p><p>Keep in mind, as sails are enjoyed, they slowly lose their shape and ability to perform. If these tricks don’t bring you up to the next level, it may be time to refresh some of that inventory. And, it may just get you out sailing that much more. </p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjExODU3MjEzNDcwMjg3ODQ4/11nov-12dec-subscribe-02.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"1195\">\n                        \n                    </figure>\n                    <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/48VZMQU\">Click Here to Subscribe</a></p><p>January/February 2025</p>",

Move the car forward to compensate for an eased sheet. An outboard track is helpful when reaching, but eventually maintaining proper leech tension isn’t possible. Then, focus on the middle telltales and accept that the bottom of the sail will be slightly over-trimmed, and the top will be twisted off. \nMainsail: The mainsheet should be eased until the luff of the sail begins to form a bubble, then sheet back in until it just disappears. Never be afraid of easing to check for over-trimming. The vang will become the leading control for leech tension (twist); tension enough to keep the top batten roughly parallel to the boom, keeping the leech telltales fully flying. Like the headsail, ease the sheet in puffs to accelerate and adapt to the change in apparent wind. \nSpinnaker: Asymmetrical spinnakers come in different cuts and weights to handle varying apparent wind angles and velocities. With the appropriate sail flying, ease the sheet until the forward edge of the spinnaker begins to curl. Trim back in to fill the sail and so the first panel occasionally curls. Regularly ease the sheet to check for correct trim. For more stability, the sail can be slightly over trimmed. \nThe tack line should be eased when heading deeper to increase depth and allow more rotation. Tighten the tack line when reaching. There is a conditions-dependent limit as to how deep asymmetrical spinnakers can be carried (unless you shift to flying off a pole).  \nWith a symmetrical spinnaker, square the pole to be perpendicular to the wind and then trim the sheet as you would an asymmetrical spinnaker. The pole can be dropped lower when reaching and left perpendicular to the mast when running.\nSpinnaker lead positions are typically static, but twings can be used to control the sheeting angle and apply more leech tension. These become especially helpful with low-clew sails like a code zero.\nFinal thoughts\nUnderstanding sail trim lets us shift gears as the wind builds or drops. It breathes exciting new life into any boat. Maneuvers become easier, and reefing becomes just one of many depowering techniques. \nKeep in mind, as sails are enjoyed, they slowly lose their shape and ability to perform. If these tricks don’t bring you up to the next level, it may be time to refresh some of that inventory. And, it may just get you out sailing that much more. \n\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \nClick Here to Subscribe\nJanuary/February 2025",

    "content:encoded": "<p>It was a spring afternoon and my sister Laura and I were chatting on the telephone, she in Michigan and I in Los Angeles. Days earlier, I’d accepted an invite from NAOS Yachts to tag along on a weekend getaway aboard a Lagoon catamaran to celebrate the manufacturer’s 40th anniversary. As an owner of a beloved Cape Dory 25, my regular sailing was about as far from a Lagoon as you can get, and I was curious to see what it was that drew such a massive global community to catamaran sailing.</p><p>“Did you get the video I sent?” I asked. I had the phone pinched between my ear and shoulder and was using every inch of the charger cord to reach across the kitchen and pack my weekend snack bag. </p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjExOTQ5Mzc0MzQxNzg1NTc2/05-img_6060.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"1067\">\n                        <figcaption>The rally was held at Catalina Island.<p>Photo&colon; David Blake Fischer</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>“My gawd,” Laura said after she’d watched the promo video. “These boats are amazing. Will you get your own kitchenette?”</p><p>I told Laura I didn’t know. Truth is, I’d received an itinerary but hadn’t read past the photos.</p><p>“Oh, that’s not good,” Laura said, sounding concerned. “What if you show up, and they shove a charcuterie board in your arms?”</p><p>“A charcuterie board?”</p><p>“Yes, David. What if you’re wait staff?”</p><p>Among her many qualities, my sister is an excellent phone-talker; she has a vivid imagination and has long been a cheerleader of my sailing adventures. As kids, we spent summers on a woodsy island in Northern Michigan where, when not painting our toes, braiding friendship bracelets, or throwing rocks in the lake, we spent countless hours floating around on a ramshackle 12-foot catamaran. </p><p>“Please tell me you’ve seen Below Deck,” she continued. “So much drama! Watch an episode before your trip. Just in case.”</p><p>Speaking of yacht drama, there’s been a long and spirited debate on the merits of monohulls versus catamarans. Monohull sailors accuse cat owners of being softies, the captains of floating condos that will beam reach but won’t point upwind. On the flipside, cat enthusiasts point out that a multihull can be fast, comfortable, and sail flat—and still be a sailboat. As for me, I don’t have a pony in the race. My Cape Dory 25 is good-looking but has 7 feet of beam, hunching headroom, and a below deck experience that’s approximately on par with tent camping. </p><p>“Will I ever own a catamaran? Probably not,” I told my sister. “Am I hoping the people at Lagoon will meet me, feel bad, and give me one? You bet.”</p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjExOTQ5Mzc0MzQxNjU0MDUx/02-img_5849.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"1067\">\n                        <figcaption>David grabs a selfie at the helm.<p>Photo&colon; David Blake Fischer</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>And so, my mission was clear: I would spend three days aboard a Lagoon 42, hobnob with cat owners, and dive toes-first into the multihull experience. </p><p>“Wait, you’re going sailing on a yacht?” my 10-year-old son asked when I’d hung up the phone. “You’re sleeping on it? Does it have a hot tub? Can I go?”</p><p>“Not this time,” I said, tossing sunscreen and a white button-down into my bag and zipping it up. “Daddy has catamaraning to do.”</p><p>Skies were gray and winds were wimpy when we pushed off and began the 31-mile trip from Marina Del Rey to Catalina Island. Gunnar Swanson of NAOS Yachts was my weekend captain. He’d brought our Lagoon 42, <em>Catalina Breeze</em>, up to 8 knots and was motoring us out onto Santa Monica Bay when I joined him at the helm. </p><p>“You’re good here?” he asked, stepping aside and offering me his spot in the captain’s chair. Gunnar went into the cabin and organized provisions. Meanwhile, I stood at the helm, studying an overwhelming assortment of levers, clutches, powered winches, and B&G displays, hoping there was a button that would deliver drinks.</p><p>“The boat’s so balanced,” I told Gunnar moments later when he returned. “It basically steers itself.”</p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjExOTQ5Mzc0NjEwMDg5OTYw/08-img_6023.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"1067\">\n                        <figcaption><p>Photo&colon; David Blake Fischer</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>Gunnar glanced down at the nav controls. </p><p>“Actually, I think the autopilot is on,” he said.</p><p>I took my hand off the wheel and squinted nautically into the distance. </p><p>“Ditto,” I said. “Was thinking the same.”</p><p>“The most beautiful dreams are the ones that last,” the Lagoon promo video says. Our motor-sail over to the island would span only a few hours, so I committed myself to soaking up the experience by sampling the many places one can recline on a boat with a 25-foot beam. I kicked back in the salon’s large L-shaped settee and sipped coffee. I climbed on the coachroof and leaned against the mast. On the bow, I struck a series of salty looking poses in the port and starboard rail/seats. </p><p>“Did you buy a catamaran?” One of my Instagram followers DM’d after I’d posted a video of me with my hair blown back à la Kate Winslet in <em>Titanic</em>.</p><p>“Just doing research.” I wrote back.</p><p>“Noooooo,” wrote a pal who’s a devoted monohull sailor. “Stop thisssssss!”</p><p>“Can’t stop now,” I replied. But, after I spilled coffee on my pants and nearly dropped my phone overboard, I eventually did.</p><p>Halfway to Catalina, I was in the boat’s well-appointed galley nibbling on yogurt and granola when a pair of ships appeared on the horizon. </p><p>“Twelve hundred feet long with a 167-foot beam!” Gunnar said, taking a look at the AIS. I put down my bowl and walked over to the nav station. Out the window, the big ships looked like statues but were moving at 9 knots. On deck, containers were stacked nine high like Legos. Though I’d never been so comfortable at sea, nor on a sailboat so big, enjoying a parfait so perfect, I was suddenly aware of how tiny even a 42-footer could feel.</p><p>We stayed our course and passed between the ships, a pod of dolphins came and went, I had a third coffee, and soon our destination appeared. Emerald Bay is a picturesque cove on Catalina’s west end. Quiet, sun-parched beaches, hiking trails with huge vistas, and a well-maintained mooring field make it a sweet spot for boaters in busy So-Cal.</p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjExOTQ5Mzc0MzQxNzg1MTIz/03-img_6154.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"1067\">\n                        <figcaption>Taking the leap catamaran-style.<p>Photo&colon; David Blake Fischer</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>There were 10 other Lagoons on moorings when we arrived. Charly Devanneaux and his wife, Anne-Cécile, (my weekend hosts and owners of NAOS Yachts) were the first to greet us. Charly picked me up in his dinghy and brought me aboard <em>Clapotis 2</em>, their Lagoon 52. Together, we raised some flags on the gennaker halyard, toasted the weekend with white wine, and I told him about my Cape Dory 25 and its two yachtiest features: a gimbaled Jetboil and a Porta Potti.</p><p>“Cape Dory made a good sailboat,” Charly said.</p><p>“I tell people the same, but it sounds way more legit in your French accent,” I said.</p><p>We both laughed.</p><p>That evening, on shore, Charly introduced me to a patchwork of sailors from across Southern California and beyond. Some cruised doublehanded as partners, others sailed as families, and still others with gaggles of friends. Chris Chang Dumortier was among them. She’d sailed over with her husband, Alexis, and their daughter on <em>Galileo</em>, their Lagoon 46. She talked with me about the privilege of owning a boat, the ease of entertaining friends on a cat, but mostly about how sailing has enriched their lives. </p><p>“In a fast-moving world, sailing teaches you the quality of being able to wait,” she said. “It’s not about what’s next; it’s now. On the water, the distractions are gone. For me, I connect even better with my family and friends when we’re sailing.”</p><p>The sun set; the moon rose. Back on the boat, I enjoyed a late-night conversation with Gunnar, his son, Evan, and Evan’s fiancée, Rachelle. Then, in my private cabin, I prepared to sleep in a style I never had onboard before. Is this bed only a queen? Cause I feel like a king, I thought, looking out my cabin’s window at the island. Then, within seconds, I was out.</p><p>A flock of sailors was invited to do beach yoga in the morning. I’d taken a yoga class only once before—during the pandemic, alone in an incense-filled room with an instructor who looked like Steven Seagal. But this was different. Toes in the sand, looking out at the blue Pacific water, I inhaled, exhaled, and, at one point, almost touched my toes. “Nice and easy. There’s no wrong way to do this pose,” someone said. And even if there is, and I’m hurt, I’ll still be carried home on a catamaran, I thought.</p><p>After yoga, we hiked from Emerald Bay to the top of Arrow Point. Along the path, I chatted with Oliver and Hugo of Planet Wine, a family-owned importer and distributor of French wines and spirits based in California. We talked about sailing; I asked poorly framed questions about French wine (“Is California wine French wine?”) and took approximately as many selfies as a frat boy in Ibiza. </p><p>Then, if the afternoon couldn’t get any better, Charly invited me to try e-foiling. An e-foil is a small surfboard with an electric motor and an underwater wing that creates lift and allows the board to elevate above the water. For half an hour, I tried, failed, and persisted. Then, with dad-like encouragement from Danny at Just Foil (a Foil sales shop in LA) I sort of succeeded. For a few brief seconds, I rose like a middle-aged sphinx from the water—and then plummeted.</p><p>Back on the catamaran, I rinsed off in my own private shower and told everyone who’d listen about my athletic experience. </p><p>“You showered?” Gunnar said, raising an eyebrow. Turns out the water heater wasn’t on.</p><p>“No worries,” I said. The experience of showering on a sailboat was still incredible. “I’m feeling very pampered.”</p><p>There was a dinner party on shore that evening. The itinerary suggested white attire, so I threw on a boring white button-down and blue khakis. If I wasn’t invited as staff, I would manifest it now. With a glass of wine in each hand, I floated through the crowd and made conversation.</p><p>“Are you the photographer?” one person asked.</p><p>“No,” I said. “I’m the caterer.”</p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjExOTQ5Mzc0MzQxNzE5NTg3/04-img_7199.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"1200\">\n                        <figcaption><p>Photo&colon; David Blake Fischer</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>Yeah, I was having fun, but I was also on a mission. And so, over the next several hours I picked the brains of catamaran owners to see what I would discover. Kevin Karrick had left his Slipstream 50 (catamaran) in San Francisco and came down to sail with friends on a buddy’s Lagoon. </p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjExOTQ5Mzc0MzQxNzIwMDQw/05-inset-img_7204.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"1200\">\n                        <figcaption><p>Photo&colon; David Blake Fischer</p></figcaption>\n                    </figure>\n                    <p>“Sailing to weather in a monohull can wear you down. Personally, I don’t mind, but when friends say they’re not coming back, I feel like I failed,” he told me. “Cruising cats offer the comforts of home, and I say why not? I want a boat where I can bring friends aboard and hang out. Most of all, I want them to come sailing and enjoy themselves.”</p><p>I did some serious socializing that night and the message was clear: People love catamarans, not simply because they’re comfortable, but because they allow them to share the magic of sailing with others. Also, these sailors weren’t just here to enjoy their boats, they were here to experience community.</p><p>Toward the end of the night, I was standing alone, hoping someone might accidentally tip me, when the harbor master walked up. Teddy Nguyen lives in Emerald Bay aboard his boat, a Lagoon 380. He’s part of the West End/Two Harbors Harbor Department team and was pumped when he found out the weekend event was a gathering of fellow Lagoon owners. </p><p>“I made a commitment to the sea,” he told me, “because the sea provided safe passage for my family.” In 1975, he and his family were boat refugees from Saigon to Guam. From Guam they ended up in Kansas. Years later, in Long Beach, California, a friend took him sailing on an Ericson 38. </p><p>“That was it for me,” he said. Teddy owned a Cal 39 before he found his Lagoon in San Francisco in 2020. “I got onboard and was amazed at the space. My first thought was, ‘Oh my God, I can take so many more of my friends out on the water.’ ”</p><p>I took notes while Teddy talked. I explained that I was a fellow sailor with a small monohull who’d tagged along for the weekend to get a closer look at catamaran life. Teddy understood but wasn’t focused on the differences between our boats. Instead, he saw our kinship as sailors. </p><p>“I’m in awe of the 50-foot cats, but I also know we all float on the same water,” he said. “Some boats offer more comfort, but the experience is the same. Sharing sailing and the camaraderie of the experience helps create a better world. At the end of the day, we all are brothers and sisters with a passion for the ocean.”</p><p>I slept like a baby and awoke at 5 a.m. “Not because of my circadian rhythm,” I told my boatmates later that final morning. “Because of the sunrise.” </p><p>Gunnar then explained that my cabin had opening hatches, fans, and, importantly, window blinds. You’re kidding me, I thought. It was day three and I was still discovering amenities. Maybe there IS a button that orders drinks...</p><p>After breakfast, there was time for a little last-minute fun before our sail back to Marina Del Rey.</p><p>Gunnar’s son, Evan, had climbed up on our cat’s highest platform and was doing fancy looking dives into the bay’s deep green water. I’m 42, afraid of heights, and have a mediocre cannonball, so I decided I should join.</p><p>“Get this on camera,” I said before taking a middle-aged-man leap. “I could be Lagoon’s next male model.”</p><p>The marine layer cleared and the wind built to 12 knots on the passage home. Out in the shipping channel, we raised the mainsail, sorted an issue with the furling line, and unrolled the jib. Then, for the last 15 miles, I laid back on the cat’s trampoline and enjoyed conversation with my newfound friends about life, meaning, and, of course, sailing. While we talked, water raced beneath us. Waves splashed my butt like a French bidet. But what did it matter? I was having fun.</p><p>“At the beach—time you enjoyed wasting, is not wasted,” T.S. Eliot once wrote. If you ask me, it’s the same with sailing. As kids, our little catamaran was a sailboat, sure, but it was also a 6-foot-wide swim platform, a party-pad, a place to paint your toes and endlessly chat. Back then, wasting time on the boat with family and friends was magic, just as important as sailing, and it still feels much the same now.</p><p>For me, the best thing about my weekend on a Lagoon 42 wasn’t how the boat steered (itself), how fast it went, how warm the cold water felt, or how well the window blinds might have worked (had I used them). Ironically, for me, the best part was the unique way the boat got out of the way. The way it created a space for people to let their hair down, have fun, hang out, and connect.</p><p>Sure, I’m a monohull sailor. I’ve got hifalutin’ opinions, a confirmation bias, and a small budget that will probably always keep me on a small sailboat. But, if I ever get a shot at a big cruising catamaran—as captain, owner, or even as staff—I’ll go for it. Why not? After all, there’s nothing wrong with having a little fun. </p><figure>\n                        \n                        <img src=\"https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ch_800%2Cw_1200/MjExODU3MjEzNDcwMjg3ODQ4/11nov-12dec-subscribe-02.jpg\" height=\"800\" width=\"1195\">\n                        \n                    </figure>\n                    <p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/48VZMQU\">Click Here to Subscribe</a></p><p>January/February 2025</p>",

On the bow, I struck a series of salty looking poses in the port and starboard rail/seats. \n“Did you buy a catamaran?” One of my Instagram followers DM’d after I’d posted a video of me with my hair blown back à la Kate Winslet in Titanic.\n“Just doing research.” I wrote back.\n“Noooooo,” wrote a pal who’s a devoted monohull sailor. “Stop thisssssss!”\n“Can’t stop now,” I replied. But, after I spilled coffee on my pants and nearly dropped my phone overboard, I eventually did.\nHalfway to Catalina, I was in the boat’s well-appointed galley nibbling on yogurt and granola when a pair of ships appeared on the horizon. \n“Twelve hundred feet long with a 167-foot beam!” Gunnar said, taking a look at the AIS. I put down my bowl and walked over to the nav station. Out the window, the big ships looked like statues but were moving at 9 knots. On deck, containers were stacked nine high like Legos. Though I’d never been so comfortable at sea, nor on a sailboat so big, enjoying a parfait so perfect, I was suddenly aware of how tiny even a 42-footer could feel.\nWe stayed our course and passed between the ships, a pod of dolphins came and went, I had a third coffee, and soon our destination appeared. Emerald Bay is a picturesque cove on Catalina’s west end. Quiet, sun-parched beaches, hiking trails with huge vistas, and a well-maintained mooring field make it a sweet spot for boaters in busy So-Cal.\n\n                        \n                        \n                        Taking the leap catamaran-style.\nPhoto: David Blake Fischer\n\n                    \n                    \nThere were 10 other Lagoons on moorings when we arrived. Charly Devanneaux and his wife, Anne-Cécile, (my weekend hosts and owners of NAOS Yachts) were the first to greet us. Charly picked me up in his dinghy and brought me aboard Clapotis 2, their Lagoon 52. Together, we raised some flags on the gennaker halyard, toasted the weekend with white wine, and I told him about my Cape Dory 25 and its two yachtiest features: a gimbaled Jetboil and a Porta Potti.\n“Cape Dory made a good sailboat,” Charly said.\n“I tell people the same, but it sounds way more legit in your French accent,” I said.\nWe both laughed.\nThat evening, on shore, Charly introduced me to a patchwork of sailors from across Southern California and beyond. Some cruised doublehanded as partners, others sailed as families, and still others with gaggles of friends. Chris Chang Dumortier was among them. She’d sailed over with her husband, Alexis, and their daughter on Galileo, their Lagoon 46. She talked with me about the privilege of owning a boat, the ease of entertaining friends on a cat, but mostly about how sailing has enriched their lives. \n“In a fast-moving world, sailing teaches you the quality of being able to wait,” she said. “It’s not about what’s next; it’s now. On the water, the distractions are gone. For me, I connect even better with my family and friends when we’re sailing.”\nThe sun set; the moon rose. Back on the boat, I enjoyed a late-night conversation with Gunnar, his son, Evan, and Evan’s fiancée, Rachelle. Then, in my private cabin, I prepared to sleep in a style I never had onboard before. Is this bed only a queen? Cause I feel like a king, I thought, looking out my cabin’s window at the island. Then, within seconds, I was out.\nA flock of sailors was invited to do beach yoga in the morning. I’d taken a yoga class only once before—during the pandemic, alone in an incense-filled room with an instructor who looked like Steven Seagal. But this was different. Toes in the sand, looking out at the blue Pacific water, I inhaled, exhaled, and, at one point, almost touched my toes. “Nice and easy. There’s no wrong way to do this pose,” someone said. And even if there is, and I’m hurt, I’ll still be carried home on a catamaran, I thought.\nAfter yoga, we hiked from Emerald Bay to the top of Arrow Point. Along the path, I chatted with Oliver and Hugo of Planet Wine, a family-owned importer and distributor of French wines and spirits based in California. We talked about sailing; I asked poorly framed questions about French wine (“Is California wine French wine?”) and took approximately as many selfies as a frat boy in Ibiza. \nThen, if the afternoon couldn’t get any better, Charly invited me to try e-foiling. An e-foil is a small surfboard with an electric motor and an underwater wing that creates lift and allows the board to elevate above the water. For half an hour, I tried, failed, and persisted. Then, with dad-like encouragement from Danny at Just Foil (a Foil sales shop in LA) I sort of succeeded. For a few brief seconds, I rose like a middle-aged sphinx from the water—and then plummeted.\nBack on the catamaran, I rinsed off in my own private shower and told everyone who’d listen about my athletic experience. \n“You showered?” Gunnar said, raising an eyebrow. Turns out the water heater wasn’t on.\n“No worries,” I said. The experience of showering on a sailboat was still incredible. “I’m feeling very pampered.”\nThere was a dinner party on shore that evening. The itinerary suggested white attire, so I threw on a boring white button-down and blue khakis. If I wasn’t invited as staff, I would manifest it now. With a glass of wine in each hand, I floated through the crowd and made conversation.\n“Are you the photographer?” one person asked.\n“No,” I said. “I’m the caterer.”\n\n                        \n                        \n                        \nPhoto: David Blake Fischer\n\n                    \n                    \nYeah, I was having fun, but I was also on a mission. And so, over the next several hours I picked the brains of catamaran owners to see what I would discover. Kevin Karrick had left his Slipstream 50 (catamaran) in San Francisco and came down to sail with friends on a buddy’s Lagoon. \n\n                        \n                        \n                        \nPhoto: David Blake Fischer\n\n                    \n                    \n“Sailing to weather in a monohull can wear you down. Personally, I don’t mind, but when friends say they’re not coming back, I feel like I failed,” he told me. “Cruising cats offer the comforts of home, and I say why not? I want a boat where I can bring friends aboard and hang out. Most of all, I want them to come sailing and enjoy themselves.”\nI did some serious socializing that night and the message was clear: People love catamarans, not simply because they’re comfortable, but because they allow them to share the magic of sailing with others. Also, these sailors weren’t just here to enjoy their boats, they were here to experience community.\nToward the end of the night, I was standing alone, hoping someone might accidentally tip me, when the harbor master walked up. Teddy Nguyen lives in Emerald Bay aboard his boat, a Lagoon 380. He’s part of the West End/Two Harbors Harbor Department team and was pumped when he found out the weekend event was a gathering of fellow Lagoon owners. \n“I made a commitment to the sea,” he told me, “because the sea provided safe passage for my family.” In 1975, he and his family were boat refugees from Saigon to Guam. From Guam they ended up in Kansas. Years later, in Long Beach, California, a friend took him sailing on an Ericson 38. \n“That was it for me,” he said. Teddy owned a Cal 39 before he found his Lagoon in San Francisco in 2020. “I got onboard and was amazed at the space. My first thought was, ‘Oh my God, I can take so many more of my friends out on the water.’ ”\nI took notes while Teddy talked. I explained that I was a fellow sailor with a small monohull who’d tagged along for the weekend to get a closer look at catamaran life. Teddy understood but wasn’t focused on the differences between our boats. Instead, he saw our kinship as sailors. \n“I’m in awe of the 50-foot cats, but I also know we all float on the same water,” he said. “Some boats offer more comfort, but the experience is the same. Sharing sailing and the camaraderie of the experience helps create a better world. At the end of the day, we all are brothers and sisters with a passion for the ocean.”\nI slept like a baby and awoke at 5 a.m. “Not because of my circadian rhythm,” I told my boatmates later that final morning. “Because of the sunrise.” \nGunnar then explained that my cabin had opening hatches, fans, and, importantly, window blinds. You’re kidding me, I thought. It was day three and I was still discovering amenities. Maybe there IS a button that orders drinks...\nAfter breakfast, there was time for a little last-minute fun before our sail back to Marina Del Rey.\nGunnar’s son, Evan, had climbed up on our cat’s highest platform and was doing fancy looking dives into the bay’s deep green water. I’m 42, afraid of heights, and have a mediocre cannonball, so I decided I should join.\n“Get this on camera,” I said before taking a middle-aged-man leap. “I could be Lagoon’s next male model.”\nThe marine layer cleared and the wind built to 12 knots on the passage home. Out in the shipping channel, we raised the mainsail, sorted an issue with the furling line, and unrolled the jib. Then, for the last 15 miles, I laid back on the cat’s trampoline and enjoyed conversation with my newfound friends about life, meaning, and, of course, sailing. While we talked, water raced beneath us. Waves splashed my butt like a French bidet. But what did it matter? I was having fun.\n“At the beach—time you enjoyed wasting, is not wasted,” T.S. Eliot once wrote. If you ask me, it’s the same with sailing. As kids, our little catamaran was a sailboat, sure, but it was also a 6-foot-wide swim platform, a party-pad, a place to paint your toes and endlessly chat. Back then, wasting time on the boat with family and friends was magic, just as important as sailing, and it still feels much the same now.\nFor me, the best thing about my weekend on a Lagoon 42 wasn’t how the boat steered (itself), how fast it went, how warm the cold water felt, or how well the window blinds might have worked (had I used them). Ironically, for me, the best part was the unique way the boat got out of the way. The way it created a space for people to let their hair down, have fun, hang out, and connect.\nSure, I’m a monohull sailor. I’ve got hifalutin’ opinions, a confirmation bias, and a small budget that will probably always keep me on a small sailboat. But, if I ever get a shot at a big cruising catamaran—as captain, owner, or even as staff—I’ll go for it. Why not? After all, there’s nothing wrong with having a little fun. \n\n                        \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    \nClick Here to Subscribe\nJanuary/February 2025",
