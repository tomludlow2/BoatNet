    "content:encoded": "<p>The Global Solo Challenge is a single-handed, non-stop round the world yachting event, and for the second edition on 2027-28, Ronnie Simpson (USA) returns with unfinished business. During his participation in the 2023-24 edition, he had rounded all three of the Great Capes and held 3rd place for the best part of the circumnavigation.</p>\n<p>But after Cape Horn, he was sailing north in the South Atlantic and chased by a severe storm. Due to horrible seas, he lept off the top of a wave and his mast collapsed upon landing. The ensuing hours were difficult for Simpson as he sought to secure his boat which was at risk of being damaged by the broken rig. The assessment of the situation ultimately led him to request rescue and abandon his boat.</p>\n<p>Now, with renewed determination and a new campaign, he becomes the 15th confirmed skipper for the upcoming edition. He recently bought the Class40 #15 from David Linger who concluded the GSC 2023-24 in 6th place. This Owen Clarke Design built in 2006 comes from the same mould as Cole Brauer’s First Light which may return to the GSC skippered by Australian sailor Elizabeth Tucker. It is also a sistership to Ari Kansakoski’s ZeroChallenge and Dealtry Pickford’s Metric 4T.</p>\n<p><strong>Where does your passion for sailing come from?</strong></p>\n<p>I found sailing in my early 20s and was immediately captivated by the freedom and travel, as well as the connection to nature and the elements that it represented. As I become more exposed to the sport, I became both an avid racing sailor and cruising sailor. I first discovered the Vendée Globe in 2008, and have been captivated by it ever since. I have continued to pursue solo and crewed racing, as well as cruising ever since. I have worked in the sailing industry since 2010.</p>\n<p><strong>What lessons have you learnt from sailing?</strong></p>\n<p>It has continually offered me inspiration in life and reminded me that anything is possible. Sailing has taught me to dream. Sailing has also taught me how powerful Mother Nature can be, and to have a significant respect for the elements, while also learning that almost any task or problem can have a reasonable solution.</p>\n<p><strong>What brought you to like single-handed sailing?</strong></p>\n<p>Discovering the Vendée Globe in 2008 was a major life moment for me. Nothing has ever captivated me so much, and made me say “I want to do that”, like the Vendée Globe. To that effect, I began competing in solo sailing races in San Francisco in 2010, and I raced solo to Hawaii twice in 2010 and 2012. I did a lot of solo cruising around the Pacific in my 20s and 30s, and was eventually afforded an opportunity to race in the 2023 GSC, which re-ignited my passion for solo around the world racing.</p>\n<p><strong>How do you plan to prepare for this event?</strong></p>\n<p>I have purchased Class 40 #15 Koloa Maoli in early 2025, and I plan to begin training in the Spring of 2025 in Portland, Maine and off the east coast of the USA. Dependent on budget, we will conduct a winter refit at the end of 2025 or end of 2026. I hope to be ahead of the curve and complete a qualifier in 2026 and spend 2027 really fine tuning and optimizing the platform, campaign and skipper.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think will be the biggest challenge?</strong></p>\n<p>Finding the required funding to mount a proper effort.</p>\n<p><strong>Tell us about your boat or the boat you would like to have.</strong></p>\n<p>It is a first-generation 2006 Owen Clarke design that is well-built, solid, and is already fully compliant with the GSC rules. Built by Jaz Marine in South Africa, it finished third in the 2006 Route du Rhum with Ian Munslow. The boat was moved to Maine and lightly sailed for several years before David Linger purchased the boat and re-named it Koloa Maoli.</p>\n<p>The boat is very nicely set up with good sails, a lot of solar, hydro generators, NKE electronics, and all recommended safety gear. Dependent on budget, the boat will go through a major re-fit before the 2027 GSC. Boat does have a nice, custom dodger to increase skipper protection in the cockpit.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you intend to link this personal challenge with a social message?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. As a combat-wounded US Marine and Iraq war veteran, introducing veterans to sailing to aid in their own healing is a cause that has always been very near and dear to my heart. To that effect, I am proud to again be aligned with US Patriot Sailing out of Annapolis, Maryland.</p>\n<p>I also aim to promote a circular economy, sustainability, renewable energies and ocean health throughout my campaign. I look forward to connecting with like minded sponsors and building a regional based ocean racing campaign that connects many businesses.</p>\n<p>Details: <a href=\"https://globalsolochallenge.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://globalsolochallenge.com</a></p>\n<p>The inaugural Global Solo Challenge 2023-24 sought to be a budget-friendly solo, non-stop race around the world. Using a pursuit format, 20 entrants from 34 to 70 feet had start times between August 26 to January 6 from A Coruña, Spain, with the first boat to return deemed the winner. The second edition has moved the start and finish line along the Spanish coast from A Coruña to Vigo for the 2027-28 race.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-02-19_16-36-27.jpg\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"509\" height=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-129873\" src=\"https://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-02-19_16-36-27.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-02-19_16-36-27.jpg 509w, https://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-02-19_16-36-27-300x295.jpg 300w, https://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025-02-19_16-36-27-50x50.jpg 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 509px) 100vw, 509px\" /></a></p>\n<p><em>Source: GSC</em></p>\n",

It is also a sistership to Ari Kansakoski’s ZeroChallenge and Dealtry Pickford’s Metric 4T.\nWhere does your passion for sailing come from?\nI found sailing in my early 20s and was immediately captivated by the freedom and travel, as well as the connection to nature and the elements that it represented. As I become more exposed to the sport, I became both an avid racing sailor and cruising sailor. I first discovered the Vendée Globe in 2008, and have been captivated by it ever since. I have continued to pursue solo and crewed racing, as well as cruising ever since. I have worked in the sailing industry since 2010.\nWhat lessons have you learnt from sailing?\nIt has continually offered me inspiration in life and reminded me that anything is possible. Sailing has taught me to dream. Sailing has also taught me how powerful Mother Nature can be, and to have a significant respect for the elements, while also learning that almost any task or problem can have a reasonable solution.\nWhat brought you to like single-handed sailing?\nDiscovering the Vendée Globe in 2008 was a major life moment for me. Nothing has ever captivated me so much, and made me say “I want to do that”, like the Vendée Globe. To that effect, I began competing in solo sailing races in San Francisco in 2010, and I raced solo to Hawaii twice in 2010 and 2012. I did a lot of solo cruising around the Pacific in my 20s and 30s, and was eventually afforded an opportunity to race in the 2023 GSC, which re-ignited my passion for solo around the world racing.\nHow do you plan to prepare for this event?\nI have purchased Class 40 #15 Koloa Maoli in early 2025, and I plan to begin training in the Spring of 2025 in Portland, Maine and off the east coast of the USA. Dependent on budget, we will conduct a winter refit at the end of 2025 or end of 2026. I hope to be ahead of the curve and complete a qualifier in 2026 and spend 2027 really fine tuning and optimizing the platform, campaign and skipper.\nWhat do you think will be the biggest challenge?\nFinding the required funding to mount a proper effort.\nTell us about your boat or the boat you would like to have.\nIt is a first-generation 2006 Owen Clarke design that is well-built, solid, and is already fully compliant with the GSC rules. Built by Jaz Marine in South Africa, it finished third in the 2006 Route du Rhum with Ian Munslow. The boat was moved to Maine and lightly sailed for several years before David Linger purchased the boat and re-named it Koloa Maoli.\nThe boat is very nicely set up with good sails, a lot of solar, hydro generators, NKE electronics, and all recommended safety gear. Dependent on budget, the boat will go through a major re-fit before the 2027 GSC. Boat does have a nice, custom dodger to increase skipper protection in the cockpit.\nDo you intend to link this personal challenge with a social message?\nYes. As a combat-wounded US Marine and Iraq war veteran, introducing veterans to sailing to aid in their own healing is a cause that has always been very near and dear to my heart. To that effect, I am proud to again be aligned with US Patriot Sailing out of Annapolis, Maryland.\nI also aim to promote a circular economy, sustainability, renewable energies and ocean health throughout my campaign. I look forward to connecting with like minded sponsors and building a regional based ocean racing campaign that connects many businesses.\nDetails: https://globalsolochallenge.com\nThe inaugural Global Solo Challenge 2023-24 sought to be a budget-friendly solo, non-stop race around the world. Using a pursuit format, 20 entrants from 34 to 70 feet had start times between August 26 to January 6 from A Coruña, Spain, with the first boat to return deemed the winner. The second edition has moved the start and finish line along the Spanish coast from A Coruña to Vigo for the 2027-28 race.\n\nSource: GSC",

    "content:encoded": "<p>Before the USA won an Olympic medal in the Men&#8217;s Skiff event at Paris 2024, the nation was far from the world standard in the 49er Class. After legacy teams moved on, the USA was 15th of 20 in 2012, 19th of 20 in 2016, and did not qualify in 2020. Something needed to be done.</p>\n<p>That something was for the men&#8217;s teams to not give up, and to work together. A continued culture of cooperation worked in 2024, and it is what Willie McBride, USA 49er Class Association President, seeks to continue, providing this update on recent activity:</p>\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"30%\" />\n<p>A balmy, 15 knot wind stirred the palm trees at the US Sailing Center of Miami for day three of the 2025 49er and 49erFX US National Championship. The crowd of 28 skiff racers gathered for the morning briefing was an exhibit of contrast.</p>\n<p>The field of competitors included the youngest still in high school, moving up from top finishes in the 29er fleet to take the next step on the high performance pathway, while the oldest are stepping back into the 49er from recent experiences sailing the F50 in SailGP, and training with America’s Cup teams in massive foilers. </p>\n<p>Two teammates had been racing together for over 20 years, while some have fewer than 20 days together. The fleet is equal parts young guns, dreaming of one day campaigning for the Olympics, current Olympic campaigners, and returning veterans who are coming back to help the fleet grow and develop. The latter group includes 2024 Olympic Bronze medalists in the 49er class, Ian Barrows and Hans Henken. A growing sense of momentum in the fleet is tangible.</p>\n<p>“This event is the first formal racing opportunity following a busy winter of US Sailing Olympic Development training camps in Miami, and it was a fantastic opportunity to put the work to the test and spar with solid competition,” said Rosie Chapman, US Sailing Olympic Development Director (ODP). </p>\n<p>“The winter camps were a great space to get valuable time on the water and support athletes in new classes with new partners, and to promote knowledge sharing from seasoned veterans. The Nationals turnout illustrates a positive outcome with 19 of the 23 American athletes in attendance coming straight out of US Sailing ODP training, and we’re excited to continue this momentum as a country. The future is bright for US Skiffs!”</p>\n<p>Though international activity in the skiff scene may appear quiet since Paris 2024, new entrants in the US fleet have been logging hours out of the spotlight. But the energy in Miami was proof of a renewed excitement in the skiff fleet that will make it the pathway to watch when it comes to talent in the United States this quad. </p>\n<p>In the 49erFX class, the story of the week was the steep learning curve amongst all competitors, with the bar rising each day as talented young sailors leapfrogged their skills. </p>\n<p>On day one, Kelly Cole and Ellie Glenn pushed Logan Mraz and Ronan Curnyn at the front of the fleet, each taking race wins.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Before the USA won an Olympic medal in the Men’s Skiff event at Paris 2024, the nation was far from the world standard in the 49er Class. After legacy teams moved on, the USA was 15th of 20 in 2012, 19th of 20 in 2016, and did not qualify in 2020. Something needed to be done.\nThat something was for the men’s teams to not give up, and to work together. A continued culture of cooperation worked in 2024, and it is what Willie McBride, USA 49er Class Association President, seeks to continue, providing this update on recent activity:\nA balmy, 15 knot wind stirred the palm trees at the US Sailing Center of Miami for day three of the 2025 49er and 49erFX US National Championship. The crowd of 28 skiff racers gathered for the morning briefing was an exhibit of contrast.\nThe field of competitors included the youngest still in high school, moving up from top finishes in the 29er fleet to take the next step on the high performance pathway, while the oldest are stepping back into the 49er from recent experiences sailing the F50 in SailGP, and training with America’s Cup teams in massive foilers. \nTwo teammates had been racing together for over 20 years, while some have fewer than 20 days together. The fleet is equal parts young guns, dreaming of one day campaigning for the Olympics, current Olympic campaigners, and returning veterans who are coming back to help the fleet grow and develop. The latter group includes 2024 Olympic Bronze medalists in the 49er class, Ian Barrows and Hans Henken. A growing sense of momentum in the fleet is tangible.\n“This event is the first formal racing opportunity following a busy winter of US Sailing Olympic Development training camps in Miami, and it was a fantastic opportunity to put the work to the test and spar with solid competition,” said Rosie Chapman, US Sailing Olympic Development Director (ODP). \n“The winter camps were a great space to get valuable time on the water and support athletes in new classes with new partners, and to promote knowledge sharing from seasoned veterans. The Nationals turnout illustrates a positive outcome with 19 of the 23 American athletes in attendance coming straight out of US Sailing ODP training, and we’re excited to continue this momentum as a country. The future is bright for US Skiffs!”\nThough international activity in the skiff scene may appear quiet since Paris 2024, new entrants in the US fleet have been logging hours out of the spotlight. But the energy in Miami was proof of a renewed excitement in the skiff fleet that will make it the pathway to watch when it comes to talent in the United States this quad. \nIn the 49erFX class, the story of the week was the steep learning curve amongst all competitors, with the bar rising each day as talented young sailors leapfrogged their skills. \nOn day one, Kelly Cole and Ellie Glenn pushed Logan Mraz and Ronan Curnyn at the front of the fleet, each taking race wins. Day two saw more wind, and Pierce and Fynn Olsen showed the fleet the power of a bow-down VMG mode, putting together a string of bullets. By day three, B Lindsay and Bella Casaretto (29er Youth Worlds champion) showed what they had learned through the event to move up the leaderboard with a pair of 2nds to finish strong.\nThe title came down to the final race, with four teams still mathematically in reach of the National Champion title. In the end, Logan Mraz and Ronan Curnyn (USA 8) showed a great jump in boat speed to edge out the competition, taking a bullet in the final race to secure the National Championship. Close behind, Pierce and Fynn Olsen took second place, while B Lindsay and Bella Casaretto rounded out the podium. \nThe shuffling leaderboard throughout the championship demonstrated the rapid development of the next generation in the USA 49erFX fleet, and will offer strong motivation for teams to put in the work before the next domestic event this summer in California.\nThe 49er class was a showcase of experience, skill, and depth, with five different teams claiming race wins throughout the event.

The 2025 edition will be held in the Sandpiper, a 15-foot catboat developed in 1972.\nWhile the US event uses a different boat and venue each year, the sister event in England – Endeavour Trophy – is always hosted on the east coast by Royal Corinthian Yacht Club, and has used the 13-foot RS200 for the last nine years. But in a significant shift, the Brits are replacing this English-built boat with a competing brand from the USA.\nThe Reichel/Pugh-designed two-person Melges 15, which will be launched in the UK at the RYA Dinghy and Watersports Show 2025, is new to the market in the UK with Melges Performance Sailboats to provide 30 brand-new, fully equipped boats for the event.\n“We have a three-year contract with Melges, so we are looking forward to being able to provide our 30-strong teams of invited champions this year, and going forward, with top-spec racing boats that promise to offer spectacular racing,” reports Edwin Buckley, event director and race officer.\nThe success of the Melges 15 in the USA has been unprecedented, with winter events attracting 100+ boats. “Since its launch, demand has been off the scale in the USA not only from those from other classes, but also newcomers to racing. It has been particularly popular with couples and youngsters,” shared Isaac Marsh, UK Melges 15 agent and class coordinator.\nMarsh added, “In some ways it is not a huge step away from the RS200, in fact, I would say it bridges the gap between the RS200 and RS400.

In some boats, this angle is wider than on boats with an overlapping genoa.<br />\n• Each boat has a desirable sheeting angle, and if needed, tightening the sheeting angle can help, for example, to power the boat up out of a tack sooner and help point higher into the wind.</p>\n<p>The issue is not so much about jib in-hauling, but how it is being done. Due to Class Rules not allowing a proper in-haul system, the weather jib sheet is being used, which is a flawed approach that requires a more skilled and knowledgeable crew.</p>\n<p>By using the weather sheet for jib in-hauling, you not only pull the jib clew inboard but also forward, and this makes the jib foot too full. To compensate for this, the jib lead must be further aft than normal, but this can be slow too.</p>\n<p>For example, when top crews come out of a tack, the weather sheet is pre-tensioned to the in-haul position before the primary sheet is made.

With 61 nationalities represented by its 3700+ members and some 270 Port Officers in 100 countries, OCC has a more diverse membership and a more international reach than any other bluewater sailing organization.</p>\n<p><strong>OCC SEAMANSHIP AWARD</strong><br />\nThe OCC Seamanship Award recognizes exceptional skill or bravery at sea. Pip Hare gained international attention when her foiling OMOCA 60, SV Medallia, was dismasted during the 2024 Vendée Globe Race.</p>\n<p>Pip was one of 40 sailors racing single-handed, non-stop and without assistance in what is often considered the greatest sailing race around the world. She was in fifteenth place, approximately 800 nautical miles south of Australia, when her boat lost its mast. Fortunately, Pip was not injured but she had to abandon the race and seek safe harbor.</p>\n<p>Armed with a hacksaw and gloves, she removed most of the rig, preserving the hull’s integrity and saving the boom, furlers and one outrigger. With only materials on board and her ingenuity and skill, Pip erected a jury-rigged mast, enabling her to fly the trysail. In her blog, viewed by thousands of sailing enthusiasts worldwide, Pip reported that her “slow boat to Australia” was able to make progress north. After 13 days, in conditions up to gale force winds, she made landfall in Melbourne on 28 December, 2024.</p>\n<p>“I am very humbled to receive this award from OCC,” Pip notes. She is currently trying to find another major sponsor and hopes to have a boat on the starting line for the 2028 Vendée Globe Race.</p>\n<p><strong>OCC LIFETIME AWARD</strong><br />\nVictor Wejer received the OCC’s Lifetime Award based on his outstanding 20 years of service and support to cruising sailors venturing through the Northwest Passage. Based in Ontario, Canada, Victor embraced new technologies by offering customized, personalized guidance including live group video conferences with OCC boats as they journeyed through the ice-riddled waters of the Canadian high latitudes.</p>\n<p>One of the many OCC Port Officer Representatives, Victor has taken his duties well beyond the extensive support offered to the world’s sailors. An author of the Polar Yacht Guide (which is available on the Royal Cruising Club Pilotage Foundation’s website), Victor has supported more than 100 boats transiting the Northwest Passage.</p>\n<p>As he notes, “I have gotten many calls from adventurers wanting to make the Northwest Passage. For most, I strongly advise them to stay away. A perfect crossing will have no story to tell at the end. No problems. No issues.”</p>\n<p><strong>Additional award winners for 2024 include:</strong><br />\n• Vasey Vase: Tim Riley and Carol Osborne<br />\n• OCC Jester Award: Jacqueline Evers<br />\n• David Wallis Trophy: Wim and Elisabeth van Blaricum<br />\n• Water Music Trophy: Carla Gregory and Alex Helbig<br />\n• OCC Award (members): Zdenka Griswold; Bill Weigel<br />\n• OCC Award (open): Jesse and Sharon Rose James with the Trinidad Operations Centre; Bob Bradfield<br />\n• Qualifier’s Mug: Fabian Fernandez<br />\n• OCC Events and Rallies Award: Reg Barker<br />\n• OCC Environmental Award: Ivar Smits and Floris van Hees<br />\n• Port Officer Service Award: Cristian Yanzer</p>\n<p>Nominations are made by OCC members; selection is by an experienced panel of bluewater cruisers and approved by the OCC General Committee.</p>\n",
