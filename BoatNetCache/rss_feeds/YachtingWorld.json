There's a range to suit all budgets and sailing needs, from a basic time waterproof timekeeper to a top of the range smart watch. There something for everyone, from racing to cruising sailors.</strong></p><figure><img width=\"300\" height=\"169\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/03/best-sailing-watches-2022-300x169.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium size-medium\" alt=\"best-sailing-watches-2022\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/03/best-sailing-watches-2022-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/03/best-sailing-watches-2022-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/03/best-sailing-watches-2022-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/03/best-sailing-watches-2022-2048x1151.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-image-id=\"140256\" /></figure><p>The best sailing watches can offer a multitude of functions, from MOB alerts to tidal calculations and large faced race count down timers. And yet still there&#8217;s utter simplicity of a waterproof self winding timepiece.</p>\n<p>Just as tablets and even smartphones have revolutionised how sailors use multifunction displays and instruments, so the latest smart watch technology has now firmly filtered into sailing. While we&#8217;re now familiar with using our watches to give us directions, make calls and send messages, and act as a repeater screen on our wrists ashore, so the latest sailing watches also make navigation, data and comms technology wearable afloat.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll see that Garmin have several entries in our best sailing watches guide and if you&#8217;re specifically after a Garmin, we have rounded up the best of those in this guide to the <a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/yachts-and-gear/thbest-garmin-watch-148449\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">best Garmin watch for yachting sailing and more</a>.</p>\n<p>However, the cleverest watch is not always the best watch for sailing. For regatta racing an extremely simple and speedy to operate model may suit better. Price is not always an indicator of functionality either; even some of the least expensive sailing watches can be packed with features. I&#8217;ve created a guide to large face sports sailing watches if this is something you are looking for then have a look.</p>\n<p>At the other end of the scale,  luxury horology brands – including Rolex, Panerai, and Omega among others – have long been closely associated with sailing, seeing it as the perfect sport to demonstrate their style, waterproof and ruggedised qualities, and accuracy.</p>\n<p>In making our selection of the best sailing watches, we&#8217;ve chosen those with features specifically suitable for wearing aboard. That doesn&#8217;t mean, however, that they float, so be sure to do the clasp up securely and be wary of pulling off jacket sleeves in a hurry and losing your prized timepiece overboard!</p>\n<h2>Editor&#8217;s top choices at a glance</h2>\n<div class=\"hawk-nest\" data-render-type=\"editorial\" data-model-name=\"Garmin Quatix 7,Casio Lithium Quartz,Ronstan Clear Start Race Timer,Garmin Marq Captain\" data-widget-type=\"multimodelreview\"></div>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-148806\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/10/20231012_163608-610x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/10/20231012_163608-610x400.jpg 610w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/10/20231012_163608-300x197.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/10/20231012_163608-630x413.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/10/20231012_163608.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" /></h2>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/reviews/gear-reviews/garmin-quatix-7-smartwatch-test-and-review\">Garmin Quatix 7</a></h2>\n<p><strong><em>Best smart sailing watch</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Specifications: </strong>Apple or android smart phone compatible,  Sizes: 47mm / 51mm, Weight 70g, Battery life: up to 16 days with screen on by demand, GPS tracking, waterproof to 10 ATM</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong> Large easy to read face | incredible versatility for an array of lifestyle activity | healthy wellbeing and boat interactivity | customisable to suit individual needs<br />\n<strong><em>Reasons to Avoid:</em></strong> Battery life not as good as the Quatix 6 if screen is always visible | bright facia can be distracting | touchscreen is pointless without the additional kit it interfaces with</p>\n<p>Garmin’s latest sailing smartwatch includes improvements to strengthen integration with onboard electronics.</p>\n<p>It’s a touchscreen model that can, for instance, be used to control MFD displays or Fusion audio systems, as well as Garmin autopilots.</p>\n<p>You can also pay for things with contactless payments, but you&#8217;ll need to use an intermediary app, such as Curve if you are in the UK as British banks haven&#8217;t signed up for that function directly yet.</p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s address the major change for the <a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/reviews/gear-reviews/garmin-quatix-7-smartwatch-test-and-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quatix 7</a> over the Quatix 6, and that&#8217;s the display. Plenty of folks complained about the darkness or difficulty seeing the Quatix 6 screen, so they&#8217;ve addressed that with a much brighter lit up style of screen.  It is very bright even when turned to its dimmest setting. To save the battery from being drained unnecessarily at night, there&#8217;s a night time version of the watch screen where you can view it as a digital numeric mono display, on demand, otherwise the screen is completely blank. This brighter clearer display does come at a compromise of battery life or screen saver settings.</p>\n<p>The extra screen size in the same outer bezel size though is really very nice. Maps and other tracking options can be easily seen.</p>\n<p>High end Sapphire models add a new ultra-clear AMOLED touchscreen.</p>\n<p>The watch can output directly to Strava and myfitnesspal along with other apps according to your preference. We like this watch very much indeed and it is currently the best smart sailing watch for all round functionality. Pricey though, but worth it.</p>\n<div class=\"hawk-nest\" data-render-type=\"editorial\" data-model-name=\"Garmin Quatix 7\" data-widget-type=\"review\" data-widget-title=\"Best budget watch (Casio) Best smart sailing watch (Quatix 7) Best sail race watch (Ronstan),Best Premium sailing watch (Marq Captain)\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-156819\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/06/20250220_104558-610x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/06/20250220_104558-610x400.jpg 610w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/06/20250220_104558-300x197.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/06/20250220_104558-630x413.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/06/20250220_104558.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" /></h2>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/reviews/gear-reviews/garmin-quatix-7-smartwatch-test-and-review\">Garmin Quatix 7 PRO</a></h2>\n<p><strong><em>Best smart sailing watch</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Specifications: </strong>Apple or android smart phone compatible,  Sizes: 47mm / 51mm, Weight 70g, Battery life: up to 16 days with screen on by demand, GPS tracking, waterproof to 10 ATM</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong> Large easy to read face | incredible versatility for an array of lifestyle activity | healthy wellbeing and boat interactivity | customisable to suit individual needs | has a built in led torch!<br />\n<strong>Reasons to Avoid:</strong> expensive bit of kit (but worth every penny)</p>\n<p>Garmin’s latest sailing smartwatch includes improvements to strengthen integration with onboard electronics and now sports a little red and white mini torch.</p>\n<p>It’s a touchscreen model that can, for instance, be used to control MFD displays or Fusion audio systems, as well as Garmin autopilots.</p>\n<p>You can also pay for things with contactless payments, but you&#8217;ll need to use an intermediary app, such as Curve if you are in the UK as British banks haven&#8217;t signed up for that function directly yet.</p>\n<p>High end Sapphire models add a new ultra-clear AMOLED touchscreen.</p>\n<p>The watch can output directly to Strava and myfitnesspal along with other apps according to your preference.

I have put a metal strap on mine as I find the Silicon strap, day to day can irritate my skin. But I pop on another sports strap for sportsing about.<br />\nI row, sail, swim, free dive, run, cycle, indoor row, do gym work, look up tides, sunrise and set times, Barometer, Storm alerts,  monitor my heart rate, monitor my sleep patterns, use the multiple alarms for a multitude of stuff, sync the watch to the rowing machine, and pin drop where I parked my car because I tend to forget where I put it. Thankfully I&#8217;ve never had to use the MOB alert button, but it&#8217;s good to know it&#8217;s there.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you want to know more about this and are wavering on dropping such a ton of money on it, just drop me a line and I&#8217;ll happily answer any questions you might have.</p>\n<div class=\"hawk-nest\" data-render-type=\"editorial\" data-model-name=\"Garmin Quatix 7 pro\" data-widget-type=\"review\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-156810\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/06/suunto1-560x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/06/suunto1-560x400.jpg 560w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/06/suunto1-280x200.jpg 280w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/06/suunto1-630x450.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/06/suunto1.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" /></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/reviews/gear-reviews/suunto-ocean-smart-diving-and-sailing-watch-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Suunto Ocean Smart Diving and sailing watch</a></h2>\n<p><strong>Specifications:</strong> Display: 1.43-inch AMOLED color display with sapphire glass and stainless steel bezel. Battery Life: Up to 60 hours in dive mode. Up to 50 hours with continuous GPS tracking.<br />\n<strong>Dive Features:</strong> Supports single and multi-gas modes, including air and nitrox. Utilizes the Suunto Bühlmann 16 GF algorithm for decompression management. Compatible with the Suunto Tank POD for wireless tank pressure monitoring. Customizable audio and vibration alarms for safety alerts.<br />\n<strong>Sports and Activity Tracking:</strong> Over 95 sport modes, including running, cycling, swimming, and yoga. On-wrist heart rate monitoring, step counting, calorie tracking, and sleep analysis. Advanced training features with heart rate variability analysis.<br />\n<strong>Navigation and Outdoor Features: </strong>High-precision GNSS system for accurate location tracking. Offline maps available globally at no extra cost. Barometric sensor providing altitude readings and storm alarms.</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons to Buy</strong><br />\nDual-Purpose Design (Diving + Sports Tracking), Premium Build with AMOLED Display, Offline Maps &amp; Advanced Navigation</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons to Avoid</strong><br />\nHigher Price Tag, Limited App Ecosystem,</p>\n<p><strong>What I think of it&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>This watch is a beast! As someone who enjoys both freediving and outdoor sports, this watch can handle both worlds on the water and under the water easily.</p>\n<p>The watch feels premium and rugged. The 1.43-inch AMOLED display is bright and crisp, even under direct sunlight. The sapphire glass and stainless steel bezel give it a solid, high-end feel, and I love that it&#8217;s made in Finland with renewable energy. The strap is comfortable, and despite being packed with features, it’s not overly bulky on my wrist, though let&#8217;s not pretend this thing is small, I&#8217;m used to wearing large watches, so if you do have a smaller wrist like me, it might take a little getting used to.</p>\n<p>Battery life is good but not mind-blowing. I got around 50 hours with GPS tracking, and up to 60 hours in dive mode, but with regular smartwatch use, I needed to charge it every 4-5 days. That’s reasonable, but some competitors last longer.</p>\n<p>If you’re an adventurer who dives, hikes, and trains, this watch is one of the best all-in-one solutions out there. It’s rugged, packed with features, and reliable in the water. However, if you’re strictly a runner, sailor or cyclist, a dedicated Garmin or Coros watch might suit you better for the price.</p>\n<div class=\"hawk-nest\" data-render-type=\"editorial\" data-model-name=\"Suunto Ocean\" data-widget-type=\"review\"></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-148865\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2023/09/IMG_2759-610x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2023/09/IMG_2759-610x400.jpg 610w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2023/09/IMG_2759-300x197.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2023/09/IMG_2759-630x413.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2023/09/IMG_2759.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" /></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/reviews/gear-reviews/garmin-marq-captain-smartwatch-review\">Garmin MARQ Captain</a></h2>\n<p><strong><em>Best premium sailing watch</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Specifications: </strong> Type: Smart | Size: 46mm</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons to buy:</strong> Weather and tidal data | MOB and GPS functions | Stream boat data to your wrist<br />\n<strong>Reasons to avoid:</strong> Full extent of capabilities is governed by the onboard technology it&#8217;s connected to | Premium price</p>\n<p>Tested by: MBY Editor, Hugo Andreae</p>\n<p>Our top priced pick comes from wearable tech-specialists, Garmin.

Backlit functions are essential for anyone heading offshore, whether racing or cruising.</p>\n<p>A well-fitting wristband or strap with a secure clasp is vital to keep the watch on your arm. Most sailing watches have soft rubber or synthetic wristbands, which are more durable in a marine environment, and safer than steel. Rubber straps are also lighter and easier to adjust.</p>\n<p>If you plan to use your watch for race start timing, look for programmable start sequence options, a sync button, countdowns that switch to seconds in the final stages. A loud, clear alarm or &#8216;beep&#8217; function that tells you time to the gun is particularly useful, so you can keep watching your course, trim and other boats around you during the final approach to the line rather than having to glance at your wrist.</p>\n<p>You can read more about other types of <a href=\"https://www.ybw.com/gear/best-gps-fitness-tracker-6-waterproof-options-for-water-sports-74841\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GPS enabled and waterproof fitness trackers and smart watches at YBW.com</a></p>\n<p><em>Didn&#8217;t find what you&#8217;re looking for?

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Marine Tech Editor Fox Morgan has created a short list of 16 of the best sailing watches on the market. There's a range to suit all budgets and sailing needs, from a basic time waterproof timekeeper to a top of the range smart watch. There something for everyone, from racing to cruising sailors.\n\nThe best sailing watches can offer a multitude of functions, from MOB alerts to tidal calculations and large faced race count down timers. And yet still there’s utter simplicity of a waterproof self winding timepiece.\nJust as tablets and even smartphones have revolutionised how sailors use multifunction displays and instruments, so the latest smart watch technology has now firmly filtered into sailing. While we’re now familiar with using our watches to give us directions, make calls and send messages, and act as a repeater screen on our wrists ashore, so the latest sailing watches also make navigation, data and comms technology wearable afloat.\nYou’ll see that Garmin have several entries in our best sailing watches guide and if you’re specifically after a Garmin, we have rounded up the best of those in this guide to the best Garmin watch for yachting sailing and more.\nHowever, the cleverest watch is not always the best watch for sailing. For regatta racing an extremely simple and speedy to operate model may suit better. Price is not always an indicator of functionality either; even some of the least expensive sailing watches can be packed with features. I’ve created a guide to large face sports sailing watches if this is something you are looking for then have a look.\nAt the other end of the scale,  luxury horology brands – including Rolex, Panerai, and Omega among others – have long been closely associated with sailing, seeing it as the perfect sport to demonstrate their style, waterproof and ruggedised qualities, and accuracy.\nIn making our selection of the best sailing watches, we’ve chosen those with features specifically suitable for wearing aboard. That doesn’t mean, however, that they float, so be sure to do the clasp up securely and be wary of pulling off jacket sleeves in a hurry and losing your prized timepiece overboard!\nEditor’s top choices at a glance\n\n\n\nGarmin Quatix 7\nBest smart sailing watch\nSpecifications: Apple or android smart phone compatible,  Sizes: 47mm / 51mm, Weight 70g, Battery life: up to 16 days with screen on by demand, GPS tracking, waterproof to 10 ATM\nReasons to Buy: Large easy to read face | incredible versatility for an array of lifestyle activity | healthy wellbeing and boat interactivity | customisable to suit individual needs\nReasons to Avoid: Battery life not as good as the Quatix 6 if screen is always visible | bright facia can be distracting | touchscreen is pointless without the additional kit it interfaces with\nGarmin’s latest sailing smartwatch includes improvements to strengthen integration with onboard electronics.\nIt’s a touchscreen model that can, for instance, be used to control MFD displays or Fusion audio systems, as well as Garmin autopilots.\nYou can also pay for things with contactless payments, but you’ll need to use an intermediary app, such as Curve if you are in the UK as British banks haven’t signed up for that function directly yet.\nSo let’s address the major change for the Quatix 7 over the Quatix 6, and that’s the display. Plenty of folks complained about the darkness or difficulty seeing the Quatix 6 screen, so they’ve addressed that with a much brighter lit up style of screen.  It is very bright even when turned to its dimmest setting. To save the battery from being drained unnecessarily at night, there’s a night time version of the watch screen where you can view it as a digital numeric mono display, on demand, otherwise the screen is completely blank. This brighter clearer display does come at a compromise of battery life or screen saver settings.\nThe extra screen size in the same outer bezel size though is really very nice. Maps and other tracking options can be easily seen.\nHigh end Sapphire models add a new ultra-clear AMOLED touchscreen.\nThe watch can output directly to Strava and myfitnesspal along with other apps according to your preference. We like this watch very much indeed and it is currently the best smart sailing watch for all round functionality. Pricey though, but worth it.\n\n \n\nGarmin Quatix 7 PRO\nBest smart sailing watch\nSpecifications: Apple or android smart phone compatible,  Sizes: 47mm / 51mm, Weight 70g, Battery life: up to 16 days with screen on by demand, GPS tracking, waterproof to 10 ATM\nReasons to Buy: Large easy to read face | incredible versatility for an array of lifestyle activity | healthy wellbeing and boat interactivity | customisable to suit individual needs | has a built in led torch!\nReasons to Avoid: expensive bit of kit (but worth every penny)\nGarmin’s latest sailing smartwatch includes improvements to strengthen integration with onboard electronics and now sports a little red and white mini torch.\nIt’s a touchscreen model that can, for instance, be used to control MFD displays or Fusion audio systems, as well as Garmin autopilots.\nYou can also pay for things with contactless payments, but you’ll need to use an intermediary app, such as Curve if you are in the UK as British banks haven’t signed up for that function directly yet.\nHigh end Sapphire models add a new ultra-clear AMOLED touchscreen.\nThe watch can output directly to Strava and myfitnesspal along with other apps according to your preference. We like this watch very much indeed and it is currently the best smart sailing watch for all round functionality. Pricey though, but worth it.\nI’m going to get straight to the point here, this watch is utterly brilliant. Once you put it on your wrist, you wont want to take it off. I have put a metal strap on mine as I find the Silicon strap, day to day can irritate my skin. But I pop on another sports strap for sportsing about.\nAnyway, if you want to know more about this and are wavering on dropping such a ton of money on it, just drop me a line and I’ll happily answer any questions you might have.\n\n \n\nSuunto Ocean Smart Diving and sailing watch\nSpecifications: Display: 1.43-inch AMOLED color display with sapphire glass and stainless steel bezel. Battery Life: Up to 60 hours in dive mode. Up to 50 hours with continuous GPS tracking.\nDive Features: Supports single and multi-gas modes, including air and nitrox. Utilizes the Suunto Bühlmann 16 GF algorithm for decompression management. Compatible with the Suunto Tank POD for wireless tank pressure monitoring. Customizable audio and vibration alarms for safety alerts.\nSports and Activity Tracking: Over 95 sport modes, including running, cycling, swimming, and yoga. On-wrist heart rate monitoring, step counting, calorie tracking, and sleep analysis. Advanced training features with heart rate variability analysis.\nNavigation and Outdoor Features: High-precision GNSS system for accurate location tracking. Offline maps available globally at no extra cost. Barometric sensor providing altitude readings and storm alarms.\nReasons to Buy\nReasons to Avoid\nWhat I think of it…\nThis watch is a beast! As someone who enjoys both freediving and outdoor sports, this watch can handle both worlds on the water and under the water easily.\nThe watch feels premium and rugged. The 1.43-inch AMOLED display is bright and crisp, even under direct sunlight. The sapphire glass and stainless steel bezel give it a solid, high-end feel, and I love that it’s made in Finland with renewable energy. The strap is comfortable, and despite being packed with features, it’s not overly bulky on my wrist, though let’s not pretend this thing is small, I’m used to wearing large watches, so if you do have a smaller wrist like me, it might take a little getting used to.\nBattery life is good but not mind-blowing. I got around 50 hours with GPS tracking, and up to 60 hours in dive mode, but with regular smartwatch use, I needed to charge it every 4-5 days. That’s reasonable, but some competitors last longer.\nIf you’re an adventurer who dives, hikes, and trains, this watch is one of the best all-in-one solutions out there. It’s rugged, packed with features, and reliable in the water. However, if you’re strictly a runner, sailor or cyclist, a dedicated Garmin or Coros watch might suit you better for the price.\n\n \n \n \n\nGarmin MARQ Captain\nBest premium sailing watch\nSpecifications:  Type: Smart | Size: 46mm\nReasons to buy: Weather and tidal data | MOB and GPS functions | Stream boat data to your wrist\nReasons to avoid: Full extent of capabilities is governed by the onboard technology it’s connected to | Premium price\nTested by: MBY Editor, Hugo Andreae\nOur top priced pick comes from wearable tech-specialists, Garmin. The MARQ Captain sailing watch comes packed with marine-relevant features.\nFunctions include weather and tidal data for your home port, a regatta timer to pinpoint starting times, a ‘tack assist’ function to determine whether you’re on lift or a header, a man overboard button and GPS.\nThe full extent of its capabilities is governed by the onboard technology to which it is connected, but possibilities include streaming boat data direct to your wrist wherever you are on the boat and controlling products from the Garmin-owned Fusion range of audio systems.\n\n \nNote: We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site, at no extra cost to you. This doesn’t affect our editorial independence.\nBest Smart sailing watches\n\nGarmin Instinct 2S Solar\nSpecifications:  Type: Smart | Size: 40mm / 45mm / 50mm, weight 53g(2oz)\nReasons to buy: GPS positioning on charts | barometric pressure and compass | Smartphone connectivity | An incredible amount of styles and colours | A single charge lasts 14 days\nReasons to avoid: Premium price without a premium design\nThe Instinct 2, launched in February 2022 is Garmin’s all-round watch, which they call their outdoors watch. Features that are particularly relevant to sailors include GPS positioning on charts; barometric pressure and a compass.\nIt has smartphone connectivity, receives emails and texts, and can control music via a phone. This watch also has an inbuilt thermometer and heart rate monitor.\nThe Garmin Instinct is available in no fewer than 20 different styles and colours. It’s actual diameter is 47mm (1 13/16” in) but the viewable face is 32mm (1 1/4”). The Instinct is 16mm (5/8” in) thick and weighs 53g (2 oz).\nFor racing sailors, it also has multiple start sequence options. We have an indepth review from long term testing of this watch coming soon.\nThe Garmin Instinct watch is a good alternative for anyone seeking a more moderately priced alternative to the Quatix 7.\n \n \nBest Big Screen Watch for Sailing\n\nGill Stealth Sailing Regatta Race Watch Timer\nSpecifications: Type: Digital | Size 65mm\nReasons to buy:Robust design with secure strap | Extra-large | easy to press silicon buttons | Great display\nReasons to avoid: Some consumers report issues with clasp/strap\nWith wrist, hull, mast or boom mount options, the Swiss-made Ronstan ClearStart Race Timer is aimed squarely at racing sailors.\nMade by renowned rigging and hardware company Ronstan, it’s a robust design with a secure elastic strap and substantial ‘bumper’ around the digital display.\nThe ClearStart Race Timer’s features include extra-large, easy-press silicon buttons, a highlighted start/stop button, oversized 16 mm digits set in a 65mm rotating face and a double line display simultaneously showing the race countdown and time.\nIn addition, the ClearStart Race Timer offers ‘5-4-1-0’ and Match Racing start sequence programmes, making it a great choice for competitive sailors. Ruggedly constructed and built to last, this sailing watch weighs in at 92 grammes and is water-resistant to 50 metres.\n \n\nRonstan Clear Start Race Timer\nBest Race Sailing watch\nSpecifications: Type: Digital | Size 65mm\nReasons to buy:Robust design with secure strap | Extra-large | easy to press silicon buttons | Great display\nReasons to avoid: Some consumers report issues with clasp/strap\nWith wrist, hull, mast or boom mount options, the Swiss-made Ronstan ClearStart Race Timer is aimed squarely at racing sailors.\nMade by renowned rigging and hardware company Ronstan, it’s a robust design with a secure elastic strap and substantial ‘bumper’ around the digital display.\nThe ClearStart Race Timer’s features include extra-large, easy-press silicon buttons, a highlighted start/stop button, oversized 16 mm digits set in a 65mm rotating face and a double line display simultaneously showing the race countdown and time.\nIn addition, the ClearStart Race Timer offers ‘5-4-1-0’ and Match Racing start sequence programmes, making it a great choice for competitive sailors.

This doesn’t affect our editorial independence.\n\n\n\nOptimum Time Series 3 sailing watch\nOne of the most popular sailing watches on the market\nSpecifications: Type: Digital | Size: 65mm\nReasons to buy: Great price | Highly functional | Easy to read\nReasons to avoid: It’s really big\nThe popular ‘big yellow’ Optimum Time Series 3 is a lower-priced, yet highly functional racing watch. And it truly is big – far too large for my wrist at a gigantic 65mm (2.56” in) diameter and 16mm (0.62” in) thick. It’s also available in colours other than yellow – including white, blue and pink.\nAn advantage for racing is that this watch is easy to read at a distance thanks to its huge 16mm digits. A bracket is supplied to fix it to a mast. It also has a sync button if you miss the start gun, and can then run a repeat sequence or race timer for handicap competitions.\nRobust, and water resistant to 5 ATM, with a wide elasticated strap.\n\n \n \n\nTimex Intelligent Quartz Yacht Racer watch\nBest for Analogue race sailing watch fans\nSpecifications: Type: Analogue | Size 46mm\nReasons to buy: Striking analogue display | Countdown timers\nReasons to avoid: Larger than average design | Complex to set up | lacks reset button | Expensive\nThis is a very striking analogue watch, designed to appeal specifically to racing sailors who don’t want a digital display. It features a racing countdown timers (from 5 mins, 3 mins or 1 minute), then after the start the chronometer automatically starts a race timer for up to one hour.\nThis is a larger than average design, at 46 mm (1.81” in) diameter and 14mm (0.55” in) thick.\nHowever, this watch is complex to set up, as some functions require three buttons to be pressed in sequence. There is also no ‘reset’ button for anyone who misses their start sequence timer.\n\n \n \n \n\nGill Race Watch Timer\nBest racing sailing watch for watersports\nSpecifications:  Type: Digital | Size 44mm\nReasons to buy: Water-resistant to 30 metres | Carbon housing | The sleep feature preserves battery life\nReasons to avoid: Basic design and functions\nThis striking red and black Race Watch Timer is a sailing-specific watch developed exclusively for watersports apparel company Gill. It’s water-resistant to an impressive 30 metres, with the timepiece unit encased in a reinforced carbon ABS plastic housing with a stainless steel back.\nAs well as telling the time, the sailing watch’s functions include a countdown with synchro, day, date and alarm. There’s a keyboard lock feature to you don’t accidentally change the settings and an electro-luminescent backlight allows the wearer to check the data day or night.\nA neat sleep feature preserves and prolongs battery life in a ruggedly constructed unit designed for durability and years of trouble-free service.\n\n \n\nLimit ProXR Countdown sailing watch\nBest value racing sailing watch\nSpecifications:  Type: Digital | Size: 50mm\nReasons to buy: Large, clear, easy to read display | Multiple design options | Dual time, stopwatch, countdown and pacer functions\nReasons to avoid: Lacks features/functions of more premium competitors | Chunky\nLimit has been producing watches for more than 110 years and specialises in offering a wide variety of styles at great value prices.\nFor a budget-friendly sailing watch option, the Limit ProXR Countdown comes with a large, clear and easily readable display and is backed by a two-year guarantee.\nIt also has a dual time display and stopwatch, countdown and pacer functionality.

To have a deserved break afloat; to sail somewhere different; to try before you buy, especially if deciding between monohull and multihull; to see if it’s something your crew enjoys before embarking on longer-term cruising. Or all of the above.</p>\n<p>For us, the plan seemed clear. After a decade of UK summers (an oxymoron!), where our family of four enjoys sailing dinghies and weekending our vintage micro-cruiser, it was time for some more reliable, sunny cruising. And the chance to try a modern production monohull presented an ideal opportunity for our daughters (9 and 13) to progress into yacht sailing.</p>\n<p>Dubrovnik has become a Mediterranean cruising mecca. Not only is the ‘pearl of the Adriatic’ a UNESCO world heritage site to set sail from, with an old town made extra popular by Game of Thrones, but the islands strewn between here and Split offer some of the most enchanting, manageable cruising.</p>\n<p>But I’d previously been put off the idea of chartering during summer school holidays, considering it too hot, expensive and, most of all, crowded. Thankfully, none of these preconceptions played out. In fact, from arriving in late July at Sunsail’s Dubrovnik base onwards, everything was charming. I would add surprisingly so – however there were some surprises in store.</p>\n<p>Due to work commitments, we missed the first two days, compressing our week’s charter, but with the islands all lying to the north-west, routing decisions are easy at least – if the wind co-operates!</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156774\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156774\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156774\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.2024_ss_croatia_agana_sunsail_41_sailing_9257-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.2024_ss_croatia_agana_sunsail_41_sailing_9257-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.2024_ss_croatia_agana_sunsail_41_sailing_9257-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.2024_ss_croatia_agana_sunsail_41_sailing_9257-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.2024_ss_croatia_agana_sunsail_41_sailing_9257.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156774\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chartering the new Sunsail 41.3 from Dubrovnik, a base which typically involves sailing to the north-west.

Were you stormbound you could happily while away a few days here – it’s easy to get into the old town, while quiet and relaxing with a superb pool and restaurant (Zephyrus YC), a well-stocked mini supermarket and good on-site facilities.</p>\n<p>Indeed, despite normally itching to get straight off to a nice anchorage, we stayed put&#8230; our only night in a marina (and it was free!). It was a Monday so it was quiet, a strong wind was forecast that night and we had a small tech issue so decided to relax, victual, and enjoy the facilities.</p>\n<p>The first real surprise came on boarding. I know the Dufour 41 having tested it the year before, so while the new voluminous boat was expected, the level of equipment it included was eye-opening. It was packed with mod cons I hadn’t even considered for a 40-footer, including aircon, genset, watermaker, freezer, microwave, electric toilets&#8230;</p>\n<p><em>Article continues below&#8230;</em></p>\n\n\n<div id=\"accordion\" class=\"collection-wrapper list-large \">\n\n\t\t\t\t<article class=\"loop loop-list-large row post-149782 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-races category-special-reports tag-caribbean tag-charter tag-top-stories publication_name-yachting-world loop-even loop-2 featured-image\" role=\"article\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 entry-media\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/races/how-to-take-on-a-caribbean-yacht-charter-for-racing-149782\" rel=\"bookmark\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2023/12/YAW292.prc_special_report.hr2020sat_laurensmorel_lmb3970.jpg\" class=\" wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2023/12/YAW292.prc_special_report.hr2020sat_laurensmorel_lmb3970.jpg 2000w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2023/12/YAW292.prc_special_report.hr2020sat_laurensmorel_lmb3970-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2023/12/YAW292.prc_special_report.hr2020sat_laurensmorel_lmb3970-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2023/12/YAW292.prc_special_report.hr2020sat_laurensmorel_lmb3970-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" data-image-id=\"149783\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/races/how-to-take-on-a-caribbean-yacht-charter-for-racing-149782\" rel=\"bookmark\">How to take on a Caribbean yacht charter for racing</a></h2>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</header>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\n                            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Regatta organisers are reporting a boom in Caribbean yacht charter entries, and, with more yachts available than ever before, the&hellip;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</article>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<article class=\"loop loop-list-large row post-133126 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-cruising category-features category-yachts-and-gear tag-charter tag-cruising tag-top-stories publication_name-yachting-world loop-even loop-2 featured-image\" role=\"article\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 entry-media\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/cruising/sailing-pellew-the-biggest-falmouth-pilot-cutter-in-150-years-133126\" rel=\"bookmark\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2021/08/NCC6588-scaled.jpg\" class=\" wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2021/08/NCC6588-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2021/08/NCC6588-300x188.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2021/08/NCC6588-630x394.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2021/08/NCC6588-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2021/08/NCC6588-2048x1280.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" data-image-id=\"133302\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/cruising/sailing-pellew-the-biggest-falmouth-pilot-cutter-in-150-years-133126\" rel=\"bookmark\">Sailing Pellew, the biggest Falmouth pilot cutter in 150 years</a></h2>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</header>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\n                            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The upper reaches of the River Truro are not an obvious source of sailing innovation.

Knowing most Sunsail yachts are in ownership programmes, I wondered how such a high standard spec level is decided and works out financially, so, at the end of the charter, spoke with specialist Julian Adams – see panel, page 61.</p>\n<p>Most likely we have all experienced some tired charter boats before, and it felt luxurious to step aboard a shiny new model. Of course, while a luxury to have, all these items ramp up the complexity and hog most stowage space. Our rep acknowledged this and even suggested using one of the three heads to stow the fenders.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156776\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156776\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156776\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.20240730_210009-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.20240730_210009-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.20240730_210009-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.20240730_210009-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.20240730_210009.jpg 1654w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156776\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The view of Lucas Taverna while moored stern-to.</p></div>\n<p>Unfortunately, we couldn’t get a chart briefing because the specialist was off on an emergency – the downside of not arriving on the usual handover day.

We’d had some local recommendations from a Yachting World reader, but the Sunsail team is also responsive and helpful with advice on WhatsApp.</p>\n<p>While my fellow charterers were quiet that week, I later saw just how well some used it for live recommendations and any tech queries. Likewise, Harvey’s daily weather briefings are first class.</p>\n<h2>Sailing to shellfish</h2>\n<p>Sailing up the channel between Lopud and Šipan (Eliphati) islands and the mainland brought the second surprise: just how quickly and violently the conditions can change here. Many will know the mountainous backdrop plays a big part in the local weather and cruising here, particularly thunderstorm activity. And the wind can change very quickly too. In this case we were sailing in 7 knots when a 20-knot wind band hit with a 45° change in its direction.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156780\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156780\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156780\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.20240801_112650-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.20240801_112650-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.20240801_112650-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.20240801_112650-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.20240801_112650.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156780\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Our heavenly spot off Pomen</p></div>\n<p>This led directly to the next surprise: we were not to get the sailing experience I’d enjoyed on the test boat the year before, sorry kids. All that gear obviously comes at a cost: weight. Then factor in white sails only, the drag of a fixed three-blade prop and towing a RIB dinghy and pointing and headway ability obviously diminish.</p>\n<p>That said my ‘first mate’, my eldest daughter, proved an effective hand, and the electric winches and stackpack made sailing a doddle. Also, at 40ft, the loads are all relatively light, so it’s easy enough to pull halyards by hand and quickly unfurl/furl sails for that impulsive 10-minute spell of sailing.</p>\n<p>KobaŠ is a delightful cove with a couple of restaurants, including Lukas, which belongs to ‘no problem’ Nicolas’ family. They gave us a friendly welcome and helped us dock stern-to, with 50cm of clear water below our rudder. Father told stories to guests over a glass or two, while mother knocked up some memorable seafood. We’d heard the oysters in these waters are meant to be some of the best in the world and they didn’t disappoint. Equally the calamari and (very) local chardonnay were excellent (the secret is in the stubborn vines which grow on rock faces apparently). All worth the inflated prices you pay on the islands (€230 for four).</p>\n<p>It was on discovering our first truly idyllic and almost deserted anchorage the following morning that we began to realise just how special these waters are. You go giddy with excitement, juggling between trying to capture it on camera and continually wanting to plunge into the intoxicating palette of blues. In fact, the rest of our voyage centred on trying to find the most beautiful waters to anchor and swim in. The choice is spellbinding.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156778\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156778\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156778\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.20240731_124241-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.20240731_124241-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.20240731_124241-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.20240731_124241-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.20240731_124241.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156778\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Our voyage was one of finding such delights, with laughs and cool-offs along the way</p></div>\n<h2>Lazy pace</h2>\n<p>With the light breeze still from the north-west (on the nose), any progress along the Mljet coast needed to be done under power.

The anchorages and submarine pen area looked busy so we settled for a buoy (€40 on top of the three-day €40 national park fee), which brought peace of mind and another stunning swimming location.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156785\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156785\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156785\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.a75i7024-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.a75i7024-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.a75i7024-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.a75i7024-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.FEAT_feature4.a75i7024.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156785\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Medieval old town of Korčula.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Toby Hodges and family find plenty of surprises as they charter a new Sunsail model from the famed old Croatian city of DubrovnIk\n\nWhy charter? To have a deserved break afloat; to sail somewhere different; to try before you buy, especially if deciding between monohull and multihull; to see if it’s something your crew enjoys before embarking on longer-term cruising. Or all of the above.\nFor us, the plan seemed clear. After a decade of UK summers (an oxymoron!), where our family of four enjoys sailing dinghies and weekending our vintage micro-cruiser, it was time for some more reliable, sunny cruising. And the chance to try a modern production monohull presented an ideal opportunity for our daughters (9 and 13) to progress into yacht sailing.\nDubrovnik has become a Mediterranean cruising mecca. Not only is the ‘pearl of the Adriatic’ a UNESCO world heritage site to set sail from, with an old town made extra popular by Game of Thrones, but the islands strewn between here and Split offer some of the most enchanting, manageable cruising.\nBut I’d previously been put off the idea of chartering during summer school holidays, considering it too hot, expensive and, most of all, crowded. Thankfully, none of these preconceptions played out. In fact, from arriving in late July at Sunsail’s Dubrovnik base onwards, everything was charming. I would add surprisingly so – however there were some surprises in store.\nDue to work commitments, we missed the first two days, compressing our week’s charter, but with the islands all lying to the north-west, routing decisions are easy at least – if the wind co-operates!\n\nChartering the new Sunsail 41.3 from Dubrovnik, a base which typically involves sailing to the north-west. Photo: Kelagopian/Sunsail\n\nFull of surprises\nI was genuinely impressed with the quality of ACI Marina, the Sunsail base, its staff and equipment. Were you stormbound you could happily while away a few days here – it’s easy to get into the old town, while quiet and relaxing with a superb pool and restaurant (Zephyrus YC), a well-stocked mini supermarket and good on-site facilities.\nIndeed, despite normally itching to get straight off to a nice anchorage, we stayed put… our only night in a marina (and it was free!). It was a Monday so it was quiet, a strong wind was forecast that night and we had a small tech issue so decided to relax, victual, and enjoy the facilities.\nThe first real surprise came on boarding. I know the Dufour 41 having tested it the year before, so while the new voluminous boat was expected, the level of equipment it included was eye-opening. It was packed with mod cons I hadn’t even considered for a 40-footer, including aircon, genset, watermaker, freezer, microwave, electric toilets…\nArticle continues below…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nHow to take on a Caribbean yacht charter for racing\nRegatta organisers are reporting a boom in Caribbean yacht charter entries, and, with more yachts available than ever before, the…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSailing Pellew, the biggest Falmouth pilot cutter in 150 years\nThe upper reaches of the River Truro are not an obvious source of sailing innovation. No foiling cats fly over…\n\n\nFor us the electric outboard on the Highfield RIB was the biggest hit, eliminating smells and noise and ideal for the kids to up their helming confidence. Knowing most Sunsail yachts are in ownership programmes, I wondered how such a high standard spec level is decided and works out financially, so, at the end of the charter, spoke with specialist Julian Adams – see panel, page 61.\nMost likely we have all experienced some tired charter boats before, and it felt luxurious to step aboard a shiny new model. Of course, while a luxury to have, all these items ramp up the complexity and hog most stowage space. Our rep acknowledged this and even suggested using one of the three heads to stow the fenders.\n\nThe view of Lucas Taverna while moored stern-to.\n\nUnfortunately, we couldn’t get a chart briefing because the specialist was off on an emergency – the downside of not arriving on the usual handover day. But the briefing videos are good and base manager Keith Harvey is very thorough with his drone footage of each area and zones of caution.\nI’m obviously old school because I still crave paper, including charts, cruising guides, suggested itineraries etc. However, it’s now all set up to be digital only.\nThat feeling of leaving the marina, motoring out of the channel and first hoisting sails is priceless. Šunj on Lopud is the perfect easy first/last hop, little more than an hour from the bustling city, and offers stunning clear water to laze and swim in, an amuse bouche of what was to come.\n\na quiet, protected corner in Polače, anchored with a stern line to a rock. Photo: Kelagopian/Sunsail\n\nStill not knowing how busy future destinations would be, I phoned ahead to the Lukas Taverna at Kobaš in the Ston channel, and was met with a reassuring ‘no problem’. We’d had some local recommendations from a Yachting World reader, but the Sunsail team is also responsive and helpful with advice on WhatsApp.\nWhile my fellow charterers were quiet that week, I later saw just how well some used it for live recommendations and any tech queries. Likewise, Harvey’s daily weather briefings are first class.\nSailing to shellfish\nSailing up the channel between Lopud and Šipan (Eliphati) islands and the mainland brought the second surprise: just how quickly and violently the conditions can change here. Many will know the mountainous backdrop plays a big part in the local weather and cruising here, particularly thunderstorm activity. And the wind can change very quickly too. In this case we were sailing in 7 knots when a 20-knot wind band hit with a 45° change in its direction.\n\nOur heavenly spot off Pomen\n\nThis led directly to the next surprise: we were not to get the sailing experience I’d enjoyed on the test boat the year before, sorry kids. All that gear obviously comes at a cost: weight. Then factor in white sails only, the drag of a fixed three-blade prop and towing a RIB dinghy and pointing and headway ability obviously diminish.\nThat said my ‘first mate’, my eldest daughter, proved an effective hand, and the electric winches and stackpack made sailing a doddle. Also, at 40ft, the loads are all relatively light, so it’s easy enough to pull halyards by hand and quickly unfurl/furl sails for that impulsive 10-minute spell of sailing.\nKobaŠ is a delightful cove with a couple of restaurants, including Lukas, which belongs to ‘no problem’ Nicolas’ family. They gave us a friendly welcome and helped us dock stern-to, with 50cm of clear water below our rudder. Father told stories to guests over a glass or two, while mother knocked up some memorable seafood. We’d heard the oysters in these waters are meant to be some of the best in the world and they didn’t disappoint. Equally the calamari and (very) local chardonnay were excellent (the secret is in the stubborn vines which grow on rock faces apparently). All worth the inflated prices you pay on the islands (€230 for four).\nIt was on discovering our first truly idyllic and almost deserted anchorage the following morning that we began to realise just how special these waters are. You go giddy with excitement, juggling between trying to capture it on camera and continually wanting to plunge into the intoxicating palette of blues. In fact, the rest of our voyage centred on trying to find the most beautiful waters to anchor and swim in. The choice is spellbinding.\n\nOur voyage was one of finding such delights, with laughs and cool-offs along the way\n\nLazy pace\nWith the light breeze still from the north-west (on the nose), any progress along the Mljet coast needed to be done under power. But these longer passages, particularly motorsailing in calm seas, were wonderfully relaxing.\nIt provided proper family time, with occasional cool-offs and tow-alongs, all while skirting the coastline and poking our noses into any inlets that looked inviting.\nMljet is 90% vegetation, and full of these enticing pitstops, particularly around the protected marine national park at the northern end.\nWinding through the delightful channels en route to its Polače heart, we passed numerous superyachts parked stern-to their preferred rocks in some of the choicest spots, so we were then thrilled to find a quiet corner with a good stake to tie a stern line to in the protected anchorage opposite the town.\nPolače has plenty of restaurants, a dinghy dock and useful small shops. Bike and e-bike rental stores abound as tourists typically cycle from here to the salt lakes (too hot for us, thanks).\n\nWatching the setting sun from the remote nature reserve Lastovo.\n\nThose who moor at the many restaurant quays and eat there avoid the €120 park fee, but after getting fresh supplies via dinghy we were too content with our anchorage spot and ate aboard that night. This helped confirm that the Dufour’s transom dinette/grill setup is a prime feature. Barbecuing in boardshorts, diving in to cool off, and finishing with an aft platform shower is the life!\nAround the headland is Pomena where we stumbled upon the most stunning small shoal by an islet, a patch of white sand large enough to precisely drop the pick into with just enough scope during a calm daytime. It was the most inviting water I’ve seen, our tiny slice of paradise.\nFrom here you have to decide whether to stay local, as in Mljet and the PeljeŠac peninsula, or strike out for Korčula, with its postcard old town, or the more remote Lastovo, a 20-mile sail west. We only had two more nights, but the mystique of Lastovo beckoned.\nAfter a long afternoon crossing in a dying breeze, we buzzed the north part of the island to glimpse Lastovo town nestled high in the hills, danced to cockpit tunes as we took in the western end before reaching Pasadur in time for sundowners. The anchorages and submarine pen area looked busy so we settled for a buoy (€40 on top of the three-day €40 national park fee), which brought peace of mind and another stunning swimming location.\n\nMedieval old town of Korčula. Navigation is easy line of sight between islands.\n\nA biodiversity treasure with some of the richest botanical areas in the Med, Lastovo was declared a nature park in 2006.\nYes, in hindsight, it was a long way to go on our timeframe (and further to go back into the weather), but to see the kids be water rats until after dark, then lie with them on the foredeck stargazing at what is said to be the second darkest night sky in Europe, forged an enduring memory.\nWeighing it up\nNormally when handing the boat back the next day it makes sense to get to an easy radius from the base. Which was our intention, honest. But after a long morning of beating into an unforecast wind and swell, it was too tempting not to divert back to our paradisiacal patch off Pomena, which proved so relaxing we ended up staying that night. After all the forecast was settled now wasn’t it?!\nFrom the most tranquil evening I woke to mayhem at 2am as a huge thunderstorm hit.

This is my third attempt at writing this column. The first go was interrupted by a squall. We underestimated its strength, surfed down a wave at 19 knots and then spent the rest of the watch slightly overly vigilant, as if that would make up for our previous 35-knot misjudgement.</p>\n<p>Attempt No2 was on my 0300-0600 watch. After a coffee, several snacks, meandering down the B&amp;G settings menu with no purpose, and two log entries made exactly to the minute on the hour, I conceded that writing was not a sufficiently ‘staying-awake’ activity – and stepped outside to stargaze.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/all-latest-posts/starlink-at-sea-all-change-for-cruisers-145597\">Starlink</a> I quickly realised I could log in every day – and yes, write an article about sailing, for sailors, while sailing – but I could also follow the <a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/tag/vendee-globe\">Vendée Globe</a> tracker, and see the solo racers thrashing about in the Southern Ocean, hitting speed records, and sleeping in 20-minute intervals. Their concerns are in a different league to mine, moaning about 35 knots or struggling to write a column on a 3am watch.

Go home. My longing for the sea had mysteriously vanished. The south-easterly gale was blowing us that way. It was only a matter of time before we arrived. I began staring at the western horizon, but my gaze was always met by an endless vista of large, foam-backed waves. How far offshore were we? 100 miles was just a stab in the dark. I’d literally lost the plot.</p>\n<p>By the fourth day, I was becoming numb with despair. We were also soaked to the bone and freezing cold. That night, there was very little sleep. Surely the boat would crash onto the rocks at any moment? Shortly after dawn on the fifth day, we sighted land.</p>\n<p>We had obviously been much further offshore than I had estimated. I immediately got sail up, despite the continuing onshore gale, and began careering in. It was a lee shore, but I was determined to plant my feet on it. Another night, I was convinced, would bring disaster.</p>\n<p>All day we sailed, clinging desperately to the tiller, but when nightfall came we were still several miles offshore with no idea of where we were. Then a lighthouse winked. What a wonderful thing to reach out to wandering sailors, to shine a light on their darkness. I wanted to kiss everybody, starting with Colleen, but instead I got out my stopwatch and timed it.</p>\n<p>The light was just south of Port Stephens. I knew the port well, but was uncertain about the shallow entrance in this huge sea. The decision was soon out of my hands, as the wind rapidly backed north-east, then north-west, increasing in ferocity as it did. There was no way we could get in now.</p>\n<p>I should have just laid ahull, drifting quietly in the lee of the land, but shame at my earlier bad seamanship led me to commit another folly. I ran back out to sea for several hours, the wake ablaze with phosphorescence, looking like a rocket ship flying through space on the dark side of the moon. The sky had cleared, and the stars, vivid in the blackness, added to this effect. Eventually, poor little Poeme was overwhelmed once more by wind and waves, and I had to take all sail down.</p>\n<h2>A building sea</h2>\n<p>By dawn, the wind was in the south-west and solid. Colleen, an experienced motorcyclist, estimated about 45 knots. The waves were very steep. I have no idea how high they were, only that the sight of them was impressive. Later, I discovered a 4-knot current was sucking us south against the wind, but in the moment I just thought, ‘Queensland, here we come!’</p>\n<p>Poeme was repeatedly knocked down, surfing sideways with the crests, masts almost horizontal, to judge from the angle inside the cabin. We had no intention of going outside to look. Anyway, we had more important things to worry about. The companionway doors had smashed. If Poeme capsized now, the boat could flood. I thought dully of ways to barricade the hole, but that would mean we were stuck inside, as the large hatch above had been screwed down.</p>\n<p>Remarkably little water came in through the open companionway, but plenty poured in through the planks. Pumping was almost continuous. I then discovered the cabin top had shifted. You could see daylight through the joint.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156728\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156728\" class=\"wp-image-156728 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.gettyimages_128391116-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.gettyimages_128391116-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.gettyimages_128391116-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.gettyimages_128391116-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.gettyimages_128391116.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156728\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lighthouse on Point Perpendicular.

We ceased to wonder when the gale would end. We had been wet and cold for so long it seemed we’d been born that way. No attempt to control the boat was made.</p>\n<p>We just pumped and clung to our bunks, except that Colleen cooked something every day. She even produced a special treat on my 22nd birthday. How I would have coped alone is questionable, as I was in a sort of trance by this time. I may have eaten but I would never have cooked and I would have had to do all the pumping. I may well not have survived. Colleen, a registered nurse who loved skydiving, was much tougher.</p>\n<p><em>Article continues below&#8230;</em></p>\n\n\n<div id=\"accordion\" class=\"collection-wrapper list-large \">\n\n\t\t\t\t<article class=\"loop loop-list-large row post-156450 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-cruising tag-great-seamanship tag-top-stories publication_name-yachting-world loop-odd loop-5 featured-image\" role=\"article\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 entry-media\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/cruising/great-seamanship-becoming-coastal-a-small-boat-in-big-seas-156450\" rel=\"bookmark\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1535\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.GSM_zimmerman.hornpipe_at_Start_of_Crossing_to_Jedediah.jpg\" class=\" wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.GSM_zimmerman.hornpipe_at_Start_of_Crossing_to_Jedediah.jpg 1535w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.GSM_zimmerman.hornpipe_at_Start_of_Crossing_to_Jedediah-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.GSM_zimmerman.hornpipe_at_Start_of_Crossing_to_Jedediah-630x355.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1535px) 100vw, 1535px\" data-image-id=\"156460\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/cruising/great-seamanship-becoming-coastal-a-small-boat-in-big-seas-156450\" rel=\"bookmark\">Great Seamanship: Becoming Coastal – A small boat in big seas</a></h2>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</header>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\n                            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Alex Zimmerman gives us a new perspective on small boat seafaring.

The kerosene lamps would not stay alight in these conditions, and we had no electric torches. Enveloped in total blackness, the violence continued. The severity of this gale was later confirmed by reports from two yachts that capsized while lying ahull nearby in 70 knots. Unlike these heavier craft, Poeme, being tender and lightly ballasted, simply lay over and surfed the crests sideways.</p>\n<p>Finally the wind began to ease. All sail was made over a lumpy sea, westwards without question. Anywhere in Australia would do. I steered and Colleen pumped. Poeme leaked more than ever.<br />\nAt the end of a long day, a lighthouse came into view. Three flashes every 20 seconds.</p>\n<p>I got out all my charts north of Port Stephens. It could only be Smoky Cape. Since the chart showed clear approaches, I decided to carry on through the night, but the seas soon became noticeably steeper, then steeper still, so we turned away. As we sailed back out to the east, the seas rapidly calmed. “Some current,” said Colleen, and immediately set to fixing us some dinner.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156731\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156731\" class=\"wp-image-156731 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.pict0002_2-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.pict0002_2-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.pict0002_2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.pict0002_2.jpg 1517w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156731\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Graham Cox was just 22 when he attempted to cross the Tasman Sea.

The coast was clearly visible in the distance, tantalising, evocative. Green hills never looked so lovely, but we were now becalmed within sight of land for four days.</p>\n<p>With increasing frustration, I chased every zephyr. At night, a land breeze would fill the sails and Poeme slipped along quietly. By dawn, we would be close to the lighthouse on the top of the perpendicular cliffs, convinced we’d be at anchor for a late breakfast. Then the rising sun dispersed the wind and the current began to suck us south again.</p>\n<h2>Mystery visitors</h2>\n<p>On the second night, I began hallucinating. A small figure who looked remarkably like Rupert Bear swung merrily in the rigging. More insidious, the squeaking rudder pintles turned into carping voices, one of which said, ‘When he’s half asleep like this, it would be easy to stick a knife in him and roll him overboard.’ I woke up quickly that time.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156727\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156727\" class=\"wp-image-156727 size-large\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.a-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.a-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.a-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.a-1536x863.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.a.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156727\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Berth aboard Poeme. Photo: c/o Graham Cox</p></div>\n<p>On the fourth day, a moderate southerly finally arrived. Poeme raced north all day. This time we were going to get in, even though it was dark again.</p>\n<p>I took a bearing on the light with my hand-bearing compass, estimated my distance off, marked my position on the chart, and drew a course that would take Poeme straight into the bay. I was astounded to discover, when I tried to steer this course, that Poeme was pointing at the cliffs. Swearing, I turned the boat away and returned to my chart but came up with the same result.</p>\n<p>“Something’s happened to the main compass,” I said, “we’ll have to steer using the hand-bearing compass.” But that produced the same results. Increasingly frantic, I wrestled in the cockpit with chart, a kerosene lamp which kept blowing out, and pencil, trying to steer at the same time. Colleen, unperturbed as usual, handed up coffee and dessert.</p>\n<p>There was only one rational explanation, both compasses had gone bananas. I decided to sail in by eye, guessing my distance off the cliffs. It was scary, but soon we were in the bay and breathing easy, safe at last. But where was the short breakwater mentioned in the Pilot Book? And the bay seemed a lot smaller than expected. I was just about to anchor and wait for daylight, when I saw boats moored ahead. ‘Good,’ I thought, ‘I’ll go over and anchor near them.’</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156732\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156732\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156732\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.poeme_at_cammeray_marina_middle_harbour_sydney_a-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.poeme_at_cammeray_marina_middle_harbour_sydney_a-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.poeme_at_cammeray_marina_middle_harbour_sydney_a-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.poeme_at_cammeray_marina_middle_harbour_sydney_a-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.poeme_at_cammeray_marina_middle_harbour_sydney_a.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156732\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Poeme at Cammeray Marina in Sydney’s Middle Harbour.

Elation evaporated as the hull pounded and staggered with each passing swell. The sound of splintering wood made me weep, but I mustered my last strength to try and save the boat.</p>\n<p>Over the side went the dinghy and I rowed off into the night, dropping the anchor when all the scope had been paid out. Back alongside, the dinghy suddenly disappeared beneath me and I found myself swimming in the cold sea, with full wet-weather gear and boots on. It took all our combined strength to get me back aboard Poeme.</p>\n<p>Every time the swell lifted the boat, the two of us heaved on the warp, but the keel continued to pound on the rocks. Mouths dry with fear, we re-hoisted the mainsail, to heel and reduce draught.</p>\n<p>More warp came in, but still the rocks clutched at the keel. We later discovered we were hauling poor Poeme further up the rocks. In my exhaustion, I’d rowed the anchor out in the wrong direction.</p>\n<p>Defeated, we lay on the deck, contemplating what to do next when a small rowing boat appeared. The two middle-aged men in it had simply rowed out from the beach. It was such a calm and peaceful night that there was no surf in the bay. They were fishermen, and one of them quickly took charge.</p>\n<p>“What’s the matter, matey?” he said. I thought the problem was pretty obvious, but it must have seemed incongruous to them. How could anyone get into trouble on a clear, moonlit night like this, in a bay wide open for navigation except for one little reef, marked clearly on the chart?</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156730\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156730\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156730\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.my_bio_portrait-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.my_bio_portrait-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.my_bio_portrait-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.col_GSM.my_bio_portrait.jpg 1257w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156730\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sailor and author, Graham Cox.

After laughing at the position of our anchor, the men cut the rope and towed Poeme off, putting us on a nearby mooring.</p>\n<p>“Where are you bound for, mate?” our saviour asked.</p>\n<p>“Well,” said the Great Navigator, “we left Sydney for New Zealand 12 days ago, but were driven back by a storm. Now that we’re at Smoky Cape and halfway to Queensland, we might just go there for the winter.”</p>\n<p>“This ain’t Smoky Cape, mate,” he said. “That’s Cape Perpendicular out there south of Sydney. You’re hundreds of miles off course.”</p>\n<p>“But, but&#8230;” I stuttered, realising suddenly why none of my bearings had worked out. “But I timed the lighthouse, three flashes every 20 seconds.”</p>\n<p>“Yep, that’s Point Perpendicular Lighthouse. You’re lucky you missed all the reefs out there. They’re treacherous in heavy weather.”</p>\n<p>He paused as Colleen and I looked at each other in sudden comprehension. Then he added, “Well, I reckon you’ve had enough by the look of you. Better come ashore with me for some breakfast and a shower.”</p>\n<p>Later that day, we conducted a post-mortem. It had never occurred to me that there could be two lighthouses with the same sequence, one well north of Sydney and one south. There were marked variations in length of flash and gap between them, but the differences were too subtle for me to notice.</p>\n<p>I’d also forgotten about the East Coast Current. While Poeme had skidded sideways down the face of waves, apparently being blown north, that insidious current had dragged us south at a rate the old boat would have been proud of. No wonder the waves had been steep.</p>\n<p>“So, what now?” asked Colleen, forever game. “I don’t know,” I said, looking down. “I might just stay here.” My voice carried as much of an apology as my fragile ego could offer.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’ll leave then,” she said, and within half an hour she was gone. I never saw her again.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=134985&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.co.uk%2FLast-Days-Slocum-Era-One%2Fdp%2F0646895958%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-21%26ascsubtag%3Dyachtingworld-gb-6413312250798200290-21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em><strong>Buy the Last Days of the Slocum Era from Amazon</strong></em></a></p>\n<hr />\n<h2><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2JMgfA4\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-120951 size-medium\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2019/05/YW_JUNE19_-COVER-1-152x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"152\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2019/05/YW_JUNE19_-COVER-1-152x200.jpg 152w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2019/05/YW_JUNE19_-COVER-1-303x400.jpg 303w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2019/05/YW_JUNE19_-COVER-1-379x500.jpg 379w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2019/05/YW_JUNE19_-COVER-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 152px) 100vw, 152px\" /></a>If you enjoyed this….</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"\"><em>Yachting World is the world&#8217;s leading magazine for bluewater cruisers and offshore sailors.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Knocked down, becalmed, grounded, and lost, Graham Cox’s attempt to sail from Australia to New Zealand in a 24-footer ends in near disaster\n\nFrom childhood, Graham Cox had dreamed of the ocean. Growing up in Durban, he’d spent his time hanging out near what was then called the International Jetty, where far-ranging yachts of all nations berthed to break their epic passages.\nSometimes he’d pluck up courage and ‘make his number’, to be well received by the generous tribes of the sea. His two volumes, Last Days of the Slocum Era, describe this dreaming time. The heroes he met come rollicking off the pages as though we were all in the pub together.\nAbout halfway through Volume 1, Graham leaves home with his kitbag and emigrates to Australia. It isn’t long before he has acquired a small yacht to live on. Poeme is a 24ft, engineless double-ended ketch built in the old-fashioned way of larch on oak.\nIn 1974, the call of the sea becomes undeniable. Together with Colleen, a girl he hardly knows, he sets sail for New Zealand.\nThings do not go well. We join them after a major hammering from a full gale, somewhere off Australia’s east coast, position unknown, with the wind blowing onshore.\nExtract from Last Days of the Slocum Era\nThe one thing I wanted to do now was return to the safety of Australia. Go home. My longing for the sea had mysteriously vanished. The south-easterly gale was blowing us that way. It was only a matter of time before we arrived. I began staring at the western horizon, but my gaze was always met by an endless vista of large, foam-backed waves. How far offshore were we? 100 miles was just a stab in the dark. I’d literally lost the plot.\nBy the fourth day, I was becoming numb with despair. We were also soaked to the bone and freezing cold. That night, there was very little sleep. Surely the boat would crash onto the rocks at any moment? Shortly after dawn on the fifth day, we sighted land.\nWe had obviously been much further offshore than I had estimated. I immediately got sail up, despite the continuing onshore gale, and began careering in. It was a lee shore, but I was determined to plant my feet on it. Another night, I was convinced, would bring disaster.\nAll day we sailed, clinging desperately to the tiller, but when nightfall came we were still several miles offshore with no idea of where we were. Then a lighthouse winked. What a wonderful thing to reach out to wandering sailors, to shine a light on their darkness. I wanted to kiss everybody, starting with Colleen, but instead I got out my stopwatch and timed it.\nThe light was just south of Port Stephens. I knew the port well, but was uncertain about the shallow entrance in this huge sea. The decision was soon out of my hands, as the wind rapidly backed north-east, then north-west, increasing in ferocity as it did. There was no way we could get in now.\nI should have just laid ahull, drifting quietly in the lee of the land, but shame at my earlier bad seamanship led me to commit another folly. I ran back out to sea for several hours, the wake ablaze with phosphorescence, looking like a rocket ship flying through space on the dark side of the moon. The sky had cleared, and the stars, vivid in the blackness, added to this effect. Eventually, poor little Poeme was overwhelmed once more by wind and waves, and I had to take all sail down.\nA building sea\nBy dawn, the wind was in the south-west and solid. Colleen, an experienced motorcyclist, estimated about 45 knots. The waves were very steep. I have no idea how high they were, only that the sight of them was impressive. Later, I discovered a 4-knot current was sucking us south against the wind, but in the moment I just thought, ‘Queensland, here we come!’\nPoeme was repeatedly knocked down, surfing sideways with the crests, masts almost horizontal, to judge from the angle inside the cabin. We had no intention of going outside to look. Anyway, we had more important things to worry about. The companionway doors had smashed. If Poeme capsized now, the boat could flood. I thought dully of ways to barricade the hole, but that would mean we were stuck inside, as the large hatch above had been screwed down.\nRemarkably little water came in through the open companionway, but plenty poured in through the planks. Pumping was almost continuous. I then discovered the cabin top had shifted. You could see daylight through the joint.\n\nLighthouse on Point Perpendicular.

We had been wet and cold for so long it seemed we’d been born that way. No attempt to control the boat was made.\nWe just pumped and clung to our bunks, except that Colleen cooked something every day. She even produced a special treat on my 22nd birthday. How I would have coped alone is questionable, as I was in a sort of trance by this time. I may have eaten but I would never have cooked and I would have had to do all the pumping. I may well not have survived. Colleen, a registered nurse who loved skydiving, was much tougher.\nArticle continues below…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nGreat Seamanship: Becoming Coastal – A small boat in big seas\nAlex Zimmerman gives us a new perspective on small boat seafaring. His vessels are Hornpipe, a sail and oar boat…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nGreat Seamanship: The Last Seadog. Jean-Luc Van Den Heede recalls a Southern Ocean knockdown\nFor any sailor interested in single-handed racing, Jean-Luc Van Den Heede’s The Last Seadog, just published, is a more than…\n\n\nNightfall brought the added misery of blindness. The kerosene lamps would not stay alight in these conditions, and we had no electric torches. Enveloped in total blackness, the violence continued. The severity of this gale was later confirmed by reports from two yachts that capsized while lying ahull nearby in 70 knots. Unlike these heavier craft, Poeme, being tender and lightly ballasted, simply lay over and surfed the crests sideways.\nFinally the wind began to ease. All sail was made over a lumpy sea, westwards without question. Anywhere in Australia would do. I steered and Colleen pumped. Poeme leaked more than ever.\nI got out all my charts north of Port Stephens. It could only be Smoky Cape. Since the chart showed clear approaches, I decided to carry on through the night, but the seas soon became noticeably steeper, then steeper still, so we turned away. As we sailed back out to the east, the seas rapidly calmed. “Some current,” said Colleen, and immediately set to fixing us some dinner.\n\nGraham Cox was just 22 when he attempted to cross the Tasman Sea. Photo: Graham Cox\n\nSince the wind was holding us off that patch of horrible, vertical water, we hove-to and crawled below to rest. By dawn we were becalmed on gently undulating swells. The coast was clearly visible in the distance, tantalising, evocative. Green hills never looked so lovely, but we were now becalmed within sight of land for four days.\nWith increasing frustration, I chased every zephyr. At night, a land breeze would fill the sails and Poeme slipped along quietly. By dawn, we would be close to the lighthouse on the top of the perpendicular cliffs, convinced we’d be at anchor for a late breakfast. Then the rising sun dispersed the wind and the current began to suck us south again.\nMystery visitors\nOn the second night, I began hallucinating. A small figure who looked remarkably like Rupert Bear swung merrily in the rigging. More insidious, the squeaking rudder pintles turned into carping voices, one of which said, ‘When he’s half asleep like this, it would be easy to stick a knife in him and roll him overboard.’ I woke up quickly that time.\n\nBerth aboard Poeme. Photo: c/o Graham Cox\n\nOn the fourth day, a moderate southerly finally arrived. Poeme raced north all day. This time we were going to get in, even though it was dark again.\nI took a bearing on the light with my hand-bearing compass, estimated my distance off, marked my position on the chart, and drew a course that would take Poeme straight into the bay. I was astounded to discover, when I tried to steer this course, that Poeme was pointing at the cliffs. Swearing, I turned the boat away and returned to my chart but came up with the same result.\n“Something’s happened to the main compass,” I said, “we’ll have to steer using the hand-bearing compass.” But that produced the same results. Increasingly frantic, I wrestled in the cockpit with chart, a kerosene lamp which kept blowing out, and pencil, trying to steer at the same time. Colleen, unperturbed as usual, handed up coffee and dessert.\nThere was only one rational explanation, both compasses had gone bananas. I decided to sail in by eye, guessing my distance off the cliffs. It was scary, but soon we were in the bay and breathing easy, safe at last. But where was the short breakwater mentioned in the Pilot Book? And the bay seemed a lot smaller than expected. I was just about to anchor and wait for daylight, when I saw boats moored ahead. ‘Good,’ I thought, ‘I’ll go over and anchor near them.’\n\nPoeme at Cammeray Marina in Sydney’s Middle Harbour. She was a traditionally-built 24ft double-ended ketch. Photo: c/o Graham Cox\n\nUnexpected landfall\nJust before reaching the boats, jogging along under jib and mizzen, Poeme struck the rocks. Elation evaporated as the hull pounded and staggered with each passing swell. The sound of splintering wood made me weep, but I mustered my last strength to try and save the boat.\nOver the side went the dinghy and I rowed off into the night, dropping the anchor when all the scope had been paid out. Back alongside, the dinghy suddenly disappeared beneath me and I found myself swimming in the cold sea, with full wet-weather gear and boots on. It took all our combined strength to get me back aboard Poeme.\nEvery time the swell lifted the boat, the two of us heaved on the warp, but the keel continued to pound on the rocks. Mouths dry with fear, we re-hoisted the mainsail, to heel and reduce draught.\nMore warp came in, but still the rocks clutched at the keel. We later discovered we were hauling poor Poeme further up the rocks. In my exhaustion, I’d rowed the anchor out in the wrong direction.\nDefeated, we lay on the deck, contemplating what to do next when a small rowing boat appeared. The two middle-aged men in it had simply rowed out from the beach. It was such a calm and peaceful night that there was no surf in the bay. They were fishermen, and one of them quickly took charge.\n“What’s the matter, matey?” he said. I thought the problem was pretty obvious, but it must have seemed incongruous to them. How could anyone get into trouble on a clear, moonlit night like this, in a bay wide open for navigation except for one little reef, marked clearly on the chart?\n\nSailor and author, Graham Cox. Photo: c/o Graham Cox\n\nThe tide was rising. After laughing at the position of our anchor, the men cut the rope and towed Poeme off, putting us on a nearby mooring.\n“Where are you bound for, mate?” our saviour asked.\n“Well,” said the Great Navigator, “we left Sydney for New Zealand 12 days ago, but were driven back by a storm. Now that we’re at Smoky Cape and halfway to Queensland, we might just go there for the winter.”\n“This ain’t Smoky Cape, mate,” he said. “That’s Cape Perpendicular out there south of Sydney. You’re hundreds of miles off course.”\n“But, but…” I stuttered, realising suddenly why none of my bearings had worked out. “But I timed the lighthouse, three flashes every 20 seconds.”\n“Yep, that’s Point Perpendicular Lighthouse. You’re lucky you missed all the reefs out there. They’re treacherous in heavy weather.”\nHe paused as Colleen and I looked at each other in sudden comprehension. Then he added, “Well, I reckon you’ve had enough by the look of you. Better come ashore with me for some breakfast and a shower.”\nLater that day, we conducted a post-mortem. It had never occurred to me that there could be two lighthouses with the same sequence, one well north of Sydney and one south. There were marked variations in length of flash and gap between them, but the differences were too subtle for me to notice.\nI’d also forgotten about the East Coast Current. While Poeme had skidded sideways down the face of waves, apparently being blown north, that insidious current had dragged us south at a rate the old boat would have been proud of. No wonder the waves had been steep.\n“So, what now?” asked Colleen, forever game. “I don’t know,” I said, looking down. “I might just stay here.” My voice carried as much of an apology as my fragile ego could offer.\n“Well, I’ll leave then,” she said, and within half an hour she was gone. I never saw her again.\nBuy the Last Days of the Slocum Era from Amazon\nIf you enjoyed this….\nYachting World is the world’s leading magazine for bluewater cruisers and offshore sailors.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "The Evo 60, a modern-looking luxury catamaran expected to cost around $3.5m, will debut at the International Multihull Show in 2026.\nThe Evo 60\nThe Evo 60 is an eye-opening, performance-focused luxury cruising catamaran and a full South African project. Drawn by top multihull designer Anton Du Toit (Balance Yachts’ designer), who grew up on a cruising yacht and is self-taught, the first Evo 60 is already in construction at Evolution Marine in Cape Town.\nThis is a young company with plenty of experience behind it. Led by veteran boatbuilder Oliver Dawson, the yard specialises in advanced composite work, with recent projects varying from a Class 40 to high-speed ferries, accommodation pods and even a replica of a GT40 sports car.\n\nEvolution Marine aims to build 12 Evo 60s over the next four years at its Cape Town manufacturing facility\n\nThe powerful, modern-looking cat is being promoted as capable of both regatta sailing and bluewater cruising. A fully infused E-glass/carbon epoxy structure will go some way to meeting its brief for strong, safe high-speed. Around 80% of the Evo 60 is carbon, including rig, appendages, crossbeam and longeron.\nDawson’s conservative estimate is that the lightweight displacement of the first boat will only be 13.5 tonnes. He says their objective is to make this high-performance cruising catamaran experience closer to that of a monohull superyacht, yet “with a similar power-to-weight ratio as the Gunboat 68, she should perform exceptionally well”.\nThe aft-mounted wheels provide articulating helm positions, an advancement on the now popular pivot systems, which should give “a monohull-like sailing experience, especially in the outboard performance mode,” Dawson continues. Push-button controls and a self-tacking jib will help enable short-handed use.\n\nEvo 60’s emphasis will be on spacious luxury, speed and comfortable cruising\n\nA glance at the Evo 60 renderings tells you there’s as big a focus on liveability and luxury as there is on performance. The covered cockpit, saloon space and galley with island provide significant socialising space. And the layout of the first boat has an opulent owner’s hull swallowing the full port-side hull, including transverse berth. Three interior design themes are offered.\nEvolution Marine is gearing up to build 12 yachts over the next four years. The first is progressing without an owner as Dawson wants it at the start of the Cape to Rio Race at the end of this year. It will then make its debut at the International Multihull Show in 2026.\n\nThe saloon has a miami beach-house feel\n\nWhen you compare the much shorter lead time and price against similar performance cruising cats from HH and Balance etc, Evo could make an attractive proposition.\nArticle continues below…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nBest catamaran and multihull: We sail the very best yachts on two and three hulls\nThere are many categories in the European Yacht of the Year awards, from the best luxury yachts and performance yachts to the best yachts for families and event a best…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nExcess 13 first look: A light and airy catamaran for easy enjoyment\nReceiving a limited edition Lego set is one of the most surprising (and best) ways I’ve seen to announce a…\n\n\nEvo 60 Specifications:\nLOA: 18.27m 60ft 0in\nevolutionmarine.co.za\n\nThe Evo 60’s price is expected to be around $3.5m\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this….\nYachting World is the world’s leading magazine for bluewater cruisers and offshore sailors.

For <a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/events-2/don-mcintyre-the-adventurer-who-launched-retro-round-the-world-racing-150425\">Don McIntyre</a>, the restless mind behind the Globe 5.80, his newest race is an idea with simplicity and accessibility at its core.</p>\n<p>And while his previous events – the <a href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/boat-events/golden-globe-race\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Golden Globe Race</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pbo.co.uk/event/ocean-globe-race-2023-everything-you-need-to-know-79620\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ocean Globe Race</a> – were ‘revival’ events that specified vintage designs to race in modern recreations of races from the 1960s and 1970s, the Mini Globe Race is an all-new concept that called for an all-new design.</p>\n<p>“I just love little boats and big adventures,” he explained. “I’m not doing it for money. There is none! It will be a low impact and sustainable adventure for all those who choose to take up the challenge. Perhaps, where the comfort of a high standard of living we all aspire to is flat-lining, the Mini Globe will be a chance for individuals to define who they really are.”</p>\n<p>While established rallies and races offer a high level of support, and boats can be built with an abundance of comfort and greatly increased levels of safety, the uptake of the Globe 5.80 challenge would suggest many are seeking out something more pared back to bare essentials.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156703\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156703\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156703\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.prc_extra_boats.img_0822_globe_5_80_downwind-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.prc_extra_boats.img_0822_globe_5_80_downwind-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.prc_extra_boats.img_0822_globe_5_80_downwind-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.prc_extra_boats.img_0822_globe_5_80_downwind-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW306.prc_extra_boats.img_0822_globe_5_80_downwind.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156703\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Downwind the 5.80 can carry a 25.6m2 A3, or a 19.3m2 A5 asymmetric. Photo: MGR2025</p></div>\n<p>The Mini Globe Race promises an adventure that will not only connect each participant – 15 skippers are currently bidding to qualify – with the challenge of ocean sailing, but also the experience of living very simply on each passage.</p>\n<p>Many participants are not only racing, but have also built their 5.80s from a series of licenced plans and kits, adding another dimension to the challenge and a unique sense of satisfaction to each project.</p>\n<h2>Human scale</h2>\n<p>In a yacht that was created for single-handing from day one, there is a rare singularity to the design of the 5.80 that is striking as soon as you step on board.

It doesn’t make for easy entry or exit, but is one of many features designed to maximise safety. Photo: David Harding</p></div>\n<p>“A really good friend I met on the Clipper was trying to persuade me to buy a boat with him, but sadly he passed away, so this is also a mechanism to have those big sailing adventures in his memory,” he explains.</p>\n<p>“There was a lot that appealed about the design, it was obviously incredibly strong, something that’s become even clearer as it has come together. I’d say that I have average DIY skills and the learning part of building her has been tremendous. The 5.80 builder’s group on Facebook is a source of a lot of help and there is a great sense of community between builders across the world.</p>\n<p>“My build has slowed, as I went back to work, but this year she will be completely watertight, at which point I can take the tent down.”</p>\n<p>Building the 5.80 from plywood, Bumby explains, has also been a journey of discovery into the realities of home boatbuilding with only a basic level of skills and equipment. “You start off aiming for perfection, but as it progresses you realise that you are ultimately aiming to build something strong, then add strength with the fibreglass. It’s an exercise in building a tough boat to do a job, rather than something perfect.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156698\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156698\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156698\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/PBO297.feat_test_globe_580.4_comm-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/PBO297.feat_test_globe_580.4_comm-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/PBO297.feat_test_globe_580.4_comm-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/PBO297.feat_test_globe_580.4_comm-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/PBO297.feat_test_globe_580.4_comm.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156698\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Accommodation is basic and functional; raised coachroof aft gives good visibility from below decks; watertight hatch to forward compartment.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "The Mini Globe Race is a single-handed around the world race in home-built plywood yachts, for a new class designed specifically for the race: the Globe 5.80. Additional reporting by David Harding\n\n“Go small, go cheap, go now,” famously said Lin and Larry Pardy, who sailed for decades aboard small engineless yachts they built themselves. For Don McIntyre, the restless mind behind the Globe 5.80, his newest race is an idea with simplicity and accessibility at its core.\nAnd while his previous events – the Golden Globe Race and Ocean Globe Race – were ‘revival’ events that specified vintage designs to race in modern recreations of races from the 1960s and 1970s, the Mini Globe Race is an all-new concept that called for an all-new design.\n“I just love little boats and big adventures,” he explained. “I’m not doing it for money. There is none! It will be a low impact and sustainable adventure for all those who choose to take up the challenge. Perhaps, where the comfort of a high standard of living we all aspire to is flat-lining, the Mini Globe will be a chance for individuals to define who they really are.”\nWhile established rallies and races offer a high level of support, and boats can be built with an abundance of comfort and greatly increased levels of safety, the uptake of the Globe 5.80 challenge would suggest many are seeking out something more pared back to bare essentials.\n\nDownwind the 5.80 can carry a 25.6m2 A3, or a 19.3m2 A5 asymmetric. Photo: MGR2025\n\nThe Mini Globe Race promises an adventure that will not only connect each participant – 15 skippers are currently bidding to qualify – with the challenge of ocean sailing, but also the experience of living very simply on each passage.\nMany participants are not only racing, but have also built their 5.80s from a series of licenced plans and kits, adding another dimension to the challenge and a unique sense of satisfaction to each project.\nHuman scale\nIn a yacht that was created for single-handing from day one, there is a rare singularity to the design of the 5.80 that is striking as soon as you step on board. The rigging is slight, the sails small, the overall scale diminutive. Despite this, it works elegantly, and it’s not a huge leap to imagine a long ocean passage aboard.\nArticle continues below…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nExtraordinary boats: The Yachting World Diamond from design to deck\nDuring the post-World War II boom years of small-boat sailing, Yachting World promoted some 30 designs, most of which allowed…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nExtraordinary boats: Scow-bowed Ace 30\nScow bow designs are still very rare in the UK and mostly elsewhere in northern Europe.

Aft, one part of the yacht that appears almost overbuilt is the wind vane self-steering gear, the primary autopilot.\nHowever, it’s when stepping down into the yacht – a surprisingly long way down – that you feel most at home.

Most builders are outsourcing the build of metal parts and the keel, while some components, including the chain plates and stainless steel rudder fittings, must be ordered from the approved supplier for safety reasons.\nThere are component packages on offer, including spars from Seldén, though you can buy from elsewhere or even make your own rig if you prefer; a deck-hardware package (excluding winches) is available from Blue Shark in China, and a sail package by Quantum. The mast and boom can be home built (using extrusions of a specified size), along with the self-steering gear, though it’s envisaged most will use ready-built servo pendulum systems.\nWatertight bulkheads and forward bulkhead hatches are a mandatory part of the design, along with a brightly coloured doghouse, which must have 360° vision.\n\nGrab handles have to be fitted in specific places, but most of the rest of the deck hardware choices are down to the builder. Photo: David Harding\n\nThe three watertight areas of the 5.80 are designed to protect it in the event of a collision, and race organisers claim it is better placed in such an event than almost every other yacht ever built of its size. Additionally, builders can choose to add removable foam pieces to the hull with buoyancy in excess of the total weight to make the yacht ‘unsinkable’.\nPersonal goals\n“I started building during lockdown and began by building a tent on my driveway,” explains home builder Peter Bumby.\n“Initially some neighbours thought I was putting up some kind of Covid test centre on the driveway – since learning what I was really doing they have shown a lot of interest.”\nA crew member on the 2013 Clipper Round the World Race, Bumby’s 5.80 build is not entered in the 2025 Mini Globe Race, but he has ambitions for his small yacht.\n\nAccess to the cabin is via a watertight hatch. It doesn’t make for easy entry or exit, but is one of many features designed to maximise safety. Photo: David Harding\n\n“A really good friend I met on the Clipper was trying to persuade me to buy a boat with him, but sadly he passed away, so this is also a mechanism to have those big sailing adventures in his memory,” he explains.\n“There was a lot that appealed about the design, it was obviously incredibly strong, something that’s become even clearer as it has come together. I’d say that I have average DIY skills and the learning part of building her has been tremendous. The 5.80 builder’s group on Facebook is a source of a lot of help and there is a great sense of community between builders across the world.\n“My build has slowed, as I went back to work, but this year she will be completely watertight, at which point I can take the tent down.”\nBuilding the 5.80 from plywood, Bumby explains, has also been a journey of discovery into the realities of home boatbuilding with only a basic level of skills and equipment. “You start off aiming for perfection, but as it progresses you realise that you are ultimately aiming to build something strong, then add strength with the fibreglass. It’s an exercise in building a tough boat to do a job, rather than something perfect.\n\nAccommodation is basic and functional; raised coachroof aft gives good visibility from below decks; watertight hatch to forward compartment. Photo: David Harding\n\n“Building the 5.80, as I move towards middle age, was an answer to feeling that I needed a project to get stuck into. I’m really glad I did it.”\nThe Globe 5.80 specifications\nHull length: 5.70m / 18ft 4in\nBeam: 2.27m / 7ft 5in\nDraught: 1.40m / 4ft 7in\nWeight: 700kg / 1,543lb\nBallast: 220kg / 485lb\nSail area (main & jib): 20.1m2 / 216ft2\nKit price: From £4,145 (basic ply) to £9,115 (CNC’d sapele)\nDesigner: Janusz Maderski\nTypical cost for a basic home-built boat (plans, hull kit, materials): £25,000–£30,000\nMore: classglobe580.com\nIf you enjoyed this….\nYachting World is the world’s leading magazine for bluewater cruisers and offshore sailors.

But now we were going to where even Swedes rarely sail: the Gulf of Bothnia. From the Stockholm archipelago to the northernmost point of the Gulf it’s roughly 400 miles in a straight line. But we will be sailing a circuitous route, and there are many distractions along the way.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156674\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156674\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156674\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.anna_caroline_in_the_fading_light_august_gives_darkern_nights_credit_matthew_davey-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.anna_caroline_in_the_fading_light_august_gives_darkern_nights_credit_matthew_davey-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.anna_caroline_in_the_fading_light_august_gives_darkern_nights_credit_matthew_davey-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.anna_caroline_in_the_fading_light_august_gives_darkern_nights_credit_matthew_davey-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.anna_caroline_in_the_fading_light_august_gives_darkern_nights_credit_matthew_davey.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156674\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Anna Caroline sailing into the fading early evening light.

The prevailing winds are south-westerly, but when we were there they tended to blow from the south-south-east.</p>\n<p>To avoid having to sail dead downwind, we decide to sail north along the Swedish coast and south again along the Finnish coast.</p>\n<p>Our first stop is the quaint village of Öregrund, where we find a good spot in the small guest harbour. Öregrund is one of those little towns where it seems as if time has stood still. Wooden houses are painted in the typical red or yellow, trimmed with white. You can tell that it gets very cold here in winter: each dwelling has small windows, big chimneys.</p>\n<p>There are sturdy churches, each with a neighbouring bell tower, and fishing boats in the harbour. Tourists stroll around and we join the throngs for an alfresco dinner at one of the many terrace restaurants, celebrating our first step into the relatively unknown Gulf of Bothnia.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156679\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156679\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156679\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.gettyimages_455327629-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.gettyimages_455327629-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.gettyimages_455327629-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.gettyimages_455327629-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.gettyimages_455327629.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156679\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">View of a typical village on Sweden’s High Coast.

This is an area in the middle of the Gulf, just south of the island Kvarken. Between Stockholm and the High Coast, the land is relatively flat and covered with forest.</p>\n<p>Many islands dot the coast, so there are lots of options to anchor or tie to a rock ‘Scandinavian style’ with a stern anchor to keep the bow away from the hard stuff. In many places along the Swedish and Finnish coast, you have the choice to head ‘outside’, where there is more sea room, or ‘inside’ between the islands where you find more shelter.</p>\n<p>We moor Anna Caroline in a club harbour on the island Granskär. These club harbours are quite common in Nordic countries. Basically, it’s a harbour at a lovely island that has been owned or leased by a club for decades and members come from their different home ports to spend the summer vacation there. Visitors are often very welcome.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156683\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156683\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156683\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.s_iconic_svartklubben_lighthouse-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.s_iconic_svartklubben_lighthouse-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.s_iconic_svartklubben_lighthouse-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.s_iconic_svartklubben_lighthouse-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.s_iconic_svartklubben_lighthouse.jpg 1654w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156683\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Svartklubben lighthouse guards the entrance to the Gulf of Bothnia</p></div>\n<p>A clubhouse, including the inevitable sauna, is standard, but sometimes the harbour has a restaurant or café as well. At Granskär, they rarely see a foreign boat, so we receive a warm welcome and are spoiled with all sorts of useful advice for our journey further north.</p>\n<p>To decide on our next stops, we look at the map and at the time we have available to sail here; summers are short in this part of the world. “Why don’t we cherry pick?” Wietze muses. We choose to sail overnight to the High Coast to maximise our time there.</p>\n<p>When we cast off it’s midsummer: we sail through a night in which the sun doesn’t set and the skies keep amazing us with their hues of yellow, orange and red. In the early hours of the next morning the wind drops and we motor into the Lustholmen club harbour. There’s not a soul to be seen on the moored yachts; only fresh leaves rustling in the wind.</p>\n<p><em>Article continues below&#8230;</em></p>\n\n\n<div id=\"accordion\" class=\"collection-wrapper list-large \">\n\n\t\n</div><!-- /#accordion -->\n\n<p>After tying up, we put the kettle on and wonder what midsummer partying went on the night before as the island slowly comes back to life. Again we receive kind hospitality and lots of information about great places on the High Coast. “Ulvön and Trysunda are well-known and beautiful islands,” fellow cruiser Stig comments, “but come to my village Häggvik. We have a harbour that can accommodate your boat. It’s the best spot on the High Coast.”</p>\n<p>It’s a wonderful sail to Häggvik: the high cliffs create sudden windshifts and keep us on our toes. It feels like dinghy sailing again. When the channel narrows we drop the sails and look for the narrow passage to Häggvik – it’s much narrower than we thought.</p>\n<p>After some nail-biting moments, with the depth sounder screaming at us, the fairway widens again and we arrive at the loveliest little marina shared with enthusiastic cruisers. For provisioning we can borrow bikes to cycle to the nearest town with a supermarket.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156675\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156675\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156675\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.dwa7r9-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.dwa7r9-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.dwa7r9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.dwa7r9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.dwa7r9.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156675\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The guest port of Baggviken on the Swedish island of Mjältön</p></div>\n<p>We spot reindeer on the shore of an island on the other side of the Ratan anchorage, after a brisk sail from the High Coast to Ratan, a beautiful secluded bay.

And it’s still going on, albeit at different rates. In the northern part of the Gulf, it’s roughly 9mm per year.

We’re enjoying such a great sail, with hardly any waves, that we decide to keep going and do an overnighter to Luleå, one of the bigger cities of northern Sweden. There’s a nasty low approaching, so we tie up in the large marina.</p>\n<p>While we wait for the weather to pass, we visit the site where Luleå was first built; due to the landrise they had to move the town 7km further east to keep the harbour at sufficient depth. There’s a beautiful old town built of 404 tiny wooden cottages around a 15th century stone church.</p>\n<p>Sailing through the Luleå archipelago is at times challenging with our 2.15m draught, but we enjoy the solitude of this relatively unknown cruising ground. We see fishermen working trout and salmon nets, and a handful of sailing yachts. But mostly it is us, the birds, wooded islands and the high summer sun.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156682\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156682\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156682\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.s_club_harbour_on_bergo_n-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.s_club_harbour_on_bergo_n-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.s_club_harbour_on_bergo_n-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.s_club_harbour_on_bergo_n-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.s_club_harbour_on_bergo_n.jpg 1890w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156682\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Swedish Cruising Club harbour on Bergön at the northern end of the Gulf of Bothnia</p></div>\n<p>The club harbour on the island Bergön is a particularly magical place. Members have built a clubhouse, a wood-burning sauna and a fireplace under a circular roof. On long tables on the jetty, members and cruisers meet and share tales on endless summer days.</p>\n<p>From Bergön we motor eight miles to Töre, the northernmost navigable point on the Gulf of Bothnia, a literal high point, and turning mark of our voyage in the Gulf. A big yellow buoy marks the spot. Together with two Finnish boats, we round the mark, then tie up to a wall and walk to the nearby campsite. Just 30 miles south of the Arctic circle, we’re in shorts and T-shirts, enjoying bright sunshine and 25°C temperatures. Töre has only 1,100 inhabitants, but is a significant stopover for yachts because of the iconic yellow buoy. At the local campsite we even get a certificate for rounding it.</p>\n<p>Bergön is popular with Finnish cruisers, so we take the opportunity to gather up-to-date information. We meet Niklas and Johanna sailing their Grand Soleil 40 Zeieten around the Gulf anticlockwise, and discuss the best strategy for the Finnish coast. For miles and miles offshore it’s very shallow. Rocks are everywhere, and tend to move with the ice in winter. So, there are dredged and marked channels to the bigger cities and the main ports.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156684\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156684\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156684\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.s_pilot_buildings_at_the_ratan_bay-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.s_pilot_buildings_at_the_ratan_bay-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.s_pilot_buildings_at_the_ratan_bay-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.s_pilot_buildings_at_the_ratan_bay-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.s_pilot_buildings_at_the_ratan_bay.jpg 1890w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156684\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pilot buildings in the bay at Ratan</p></div>\n<h2>Lighthouse route</h2>\n<p>To get in, you often have to sail up to 20 miles through a channel. And the same distance out again; which deters most people from sailing along this coast. “Go for the lighthouses,” Niklas says.</p>\n<p>“When Finland was part of Russia, the government wanted the cargo ships to travel along the Finnish and not the Swedish coast. So, they built a whole series of lighthouses with small harbours on islands all along the westernmost rim of the shallow part of the coast. These harbours can accommodate government vessels, so they are deep enough for a yacht.</p>\n<p>“Pick the destinations on the mainland where you want to go and for the rest you stay ‘outside’ and use the lighthouses.” It’s a splendid idea.</p>\n<p>We’d sailed into Bergön as strangers and leave as friends; it’s that kind of place. Unexpectedly, the wind turns to the north. We rush south, to make good use of it. A quick visit to university town Vaasa, then on in more northerly winds to historic Rauma, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Both marinas in Rauma are too shallow for us, so we end up in the fishing harbour, where we find a warm welcome.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156687\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156687\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156687\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.shutterstock_365532848-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.shutterstock_365532848-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.shutterstock_365532848-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.shutterstock_365532848-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.shutterstock_365532848.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156687\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">‘Nature harbour’ mooring on the outer edge of the Stockholm archipelago.

With the help of Ari, a Finnish fellow cruiser, we got our lines ashore and safely tied up. But it was worth it: the island is a gem. It takes about 20 minutes to walk around it and we make several laps to enjoy the ever-changing light. Ari also offers excellent tips for anchorages in the famous Turku archipelago, further south. “It’s the best cruising ground in Finland,” he promises.</p>\n<p>We take a week to meander through more beautiful islands: another lighthouse landmark, and yet more cute anchorages or villages where we can tie up. The archipelago can get quite crowded in July, but by August things are slowing down, and slowly the nights get darker. It is sufficiently quiet that as we approach Turku through a winding, shallow channel, an elk swims across our bow.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156678\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156678\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156678\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.f_there_is_room_for_us_at_the_ferry_jetty_on_na_sby-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.f_there_is_room_for_us_at_the_ferry_jetty_on_na_sby-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.f_there_is_room_for_us_at_the_ferry_jetty_on_na_sby-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.FEAT_gulf_of_bothnia.f_there_is_room_for_us_at_the_ferry_jetty_on_na_sby.jpg 1417w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156678\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Marina berths are usually bow in with mooring rings</p></div>\n<h2>Back to the west</h2>\n<p>The city of Turku feels very cosmopolitan after the small villages we’ve visited.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "The Gulf of Bothnia is little explored, but Janneke Kuysters discovers stunning mid-summer cruising\n\nThe massive structure of Svartklubben lighthouse looms on the horizon. Standing on the small Swedish island of Singö, it guards the entrance to the Gulf of Bothnia. Passing it feels like we’re opening the pages of a new book.\nThat morning, we’d hauled our anchor out of the mud in the beautiful Arholma anchorage, the northernmost island of the Stockholm archipelago. Sweden has so many excellent cruising grounds, each of which can keep you busy for a lifetime.\nWe’d spent a month on the south-east coast of Sweden, meandering between the thousands of islands. But now we were going to where even Swedes rarely sail: the Gulf of Bothnia. From the Stockholm archipelago to the northernmost point of the Gulf it’s roughly 400 miles in a straight line. But we will be sailing a circuitous route, and there are many distractions along the way.\n\nAnna Caroline sailing into the fading early evening light. Photo: Matthew Davey\n\nChoosing sides\nThe first thing to decide is whether we’re going to loop around the Gulf of Bothnia clockwise or anticlockwise. The prevailing winds are south-westerly, but when we were there they tended to blow from the south-south-east.\nTo avoid having to sail dead downwind, we decide to sail north along the Swedish coast and south again along the Finnish coast.\nOur first stop is the quaint village of Öregrund, where we find a good spot in the small guest harbour. Öregrund is one of those little towns where it seems as if time has stood still. Wooden houses are painted in the typical red or yellow, trimmed with white. You can tell that it gets very cold here in winter: each dwelling has small windows, big chimneys.\nThere are sturdy churches, each with a neighbouring bell tower, and fishing boats in the harbour. Tourists stroll around and we join the throngs for an alfresco dinner at one of the many terrace restaurants, celebrating our first step into the relatively unknown Gulf of Bothnia.\n\nView of a typical village on Sweden’s High Coast. Photo: Frida Gruffman/Getty\n\nCherry picking\nWhen you ask Swedes about the northern Swedish coast, they invariably talk about Höga Kusten, the High Coast. This is an area in the middle of the Gulf, just south of the island Kvarken. Between Stockholm and the High Coast, the land is relatively flat and covered with forest.\nMany islands dot the coast, so there are lots of options to anchor or tie to a rock ‘Scandinavian style’ with a stern anchor to keep the bow away from the hard stuff. In many places along the Swedish and Finnish coast, you have the choice to head ‘outside’, where there is more sea room, or ‘inside’ between the islands where you find more shelter.\nWe moor Anna Caroline in a club harbour on the island Granskär. These club harbours are quite common in Nordic countries. Basically, it’s a harbour at a lovely island that has been owned or leased by a club for decades and members come from their different home ports to spend the summer vacation there. Visitors are often very welcome.\n\nSvartklubben lighthouse guards the entrance to the Gulf of Bothnia\n\nA clubhouse, including the inevitable sauna, is standard, but sometimes the harbour has a restaurant or café as well. At Granskär, they rarely see a foreign boat, so we receive a warm welcome and are spoiled with all sorts of useful advice for our journey further north.\nTo decide on our next stops, we look at the map and at the time we have available to sail here; summers are short in this part of the world. “Why don’t we cherry pick?” Wietze muses. We choose to sail overnight to the High Coast to maximise our time there.\nWhen we cast off it’s midsummer: we sail through a night in which the sun doesn’t set and the skies keep amazing us with their hues of yellow, orange and red. In the early hours of the next morning the wind drops and we motor into the Lustholmen club harbour. There’s not a soul to be seen on the moored yachts; only fresh leaves rustling in the wind.\nArticle continues below…\n\n\nAfter tying up, we put the kettle on and wonder what midsummer partying went on the night before as the island slowly comes back to life. Again we receive kind hospitality and lots of information about great places on the High Coast. “Ulvön and Trysunda are well-known and beautiful islands,” fellow cruiser Stig comments, “but come to my village Häggvik. We have a harbour that can accommodate your boat. It’s the best spot on the High Coast.”\nIt’s a wonderful sail to Häggvik: the high cliffs create sudden windshifts and keep us on our toes. It feels like dinghy sailing again. When the channel narrows we drop the sails and look for the narrow passage to Häggvik – it’s much narrower than we thought.\nAfter some nail-biting moments, with the depth sounder screaming at us, the fairway widens again and we arrive at the loveliest little marina shared with enthusiastic cruisers. For provisioning we can borrow bikes to cycle to the nearest town with a supermarket.\n\nThe guest port of Baggviken on the Swedish island of Mjältön\n\nWe spot reindeer on the shore of an island on the other side of the Ratan anchorage, after a brisk sail from the High Coast to Ratan, a beautiful secluded bay. This is close to the narrowest part of the Gulf of Bothnia; the part where the landrise is most visible.\nOnce the last Ice Age retreated the land of the Nordic countries started to bounce back. And it’s still going on, albeit at different rates. In the northern part of the Gulf, it’s roughly 9mm per year. Rocks that were marked at sea level hundreds of years ago are now metres higher.\n\nThe small village of Hölick on Sweden’s Hornslandet peninsula. Photo: Henk Hulshof/Getty\n\nThe far north\nFrom Ratan we make use of a steady, 20-knot south-easterly. We’re enjoying such a great sail, with hardly any waves, that we decide to keep going and do an overnighter to Luleå, one of the bigger cities of northern Sweden. There’s a nasty low approaching, so we tie up in the large marina.\nWhile we wait for the weather to pass, we visit the site where Luleå was first built; due to the landrise they had to move the town 7km further east to keep the harbour at sufficient depth. There’s a beautiful old town built of 404 tiny wooden cottages around a 15th century stone church.\nSailing through the Luleå archipelago is at times challenging with our 2.15m draught, but we enjoy the solitude of this relatively unknown cruising ground. We see fishermen working trout and salmon nets, and a handful of sailing yachts. But mostly it is us, the birds, wooded islands and the high summer sun.\n\nSwedish Cruising Club harbour on Bergön at the northern end of the Gulf of Bothnia\n\nThe club harbour on the island Bergön is a particularly magical place. Members have built a clubhouse, a wood-burning sauna and a fireplace under a circular roof. On long tables on the jetty, members and cruisers meet and share tales on endless summer days.\nFrom Bergön we motor eight miles to Töre, the northernmost navigable point on the Gulf of Bothnia, a literal high point, and turning mark of our voyage in the Gulf. A big yellow buoy marks the spot. Together with two Finnish boats, we round the mark, then tie up to a wall and walk to the nearby campsite. Just 30 miles south of the Arctic circle, we’re in shorts and T-shirts, enjoying bright sunshine and 25°C temperatures. Töre has only 1,100 inhabitants, but is a significant stopover for yachts because of the iconic yellow buoy. At the local campsite we even get a certificate for rounding it.\nBergön is popular with Finnish cruisers, so we take the opportunity to gather up-to-date information. We meet Niklas and Johanna sailing their Grand Soleil 40 Zeieten around the Gulf anticlockwise, and discuss the best strategy for the Finnish coast. For miles and miles offshore it’s very shallow. Rocks are everywhere, and tend to move with the ice in winter. So, there are dredged and marked channels to the bigger cities and the main ports.\n\nPilot buildings in the bay at Ratan\n\nLighthouse route\nTo get in, you often have to sail up to 20 miles through a channel. And the same distance out again; which deters most people from sailing along this coast. “Go for the lighthouses,” Niklas says.\n“When Finland was part of Russia, the government wanted the cargo ships to travel along the Finnish and not the Swedish coast. So, they built a whole series of lighthouses with small harbours on islands all along the westernmost rim of the shallow part of the coast. These harbours can accommodate government vessels, so they are deep enough for a yacht.\n“Pick the destinations on the mainland where you want to go and for the rest you stay ‘outside’ and use the lighthouses.” It’s a splendid idea.\nWe’d sailed into Bergön as strangers and leave as friends; it’s that kind of place. Unexpectedly, the wind turns to the north. We rush south, to make good use of it. A quick visit to university town Vaasa, then on in more northerly winds to historic Rauma, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Both marinas in Rauma are too shallow for us, so we end up in the fishing harbour, where we find a warm welcome.\n\n‘Nature harbour’ mooring on the outer edge of the Stockholm archipelago. Photo: Mikael Broms/Shutterstock\n\nOur first lighthouse harbour is Kylmäpihlaja, a tight fit for our boat, with a stiff breeze blowing across the basin. With the help of Ari, a Finnish fellow cruiser, we got our lines ashore and safely tied up. But it was worth it: the island is a gem. It takes about 20 minutes to walk around it and we make several laps to enjoy the ever-changing light. Ari also offers excellent tips for anchorages in the famous Turku archipelago, further south. “It’s the best cruising ground in Finland,” he promises.\nWe take a week to meander through more beautiful islands: another lighthouse landmark, and yet more cute anchorages or villages where we can tie up. The archipelago can get quite crowded in July, but by August things are slowing down, and slowly the nights get darker. It is sufficiently quiet that as we approach Turku through a winding, shallow channel, an elk swims across our bow.\n\nMarina berths are usually bow in with mooring rings\n\nBack to the west\nThe city of Turku feels very cosmopolitan after the small villages we’ve visited. We sail right into the centre of town, where a marina is situated on the banks of the Aura river. It’s a popular place for crew changes, restocking and sightseeing. But after a few days we head back into the archipelago.\nThe narrow, winding, and in places shallow, track makes for challenging sailing in the shifts and calms. Our last stop in the Turku archipelago is the small island Kumlinge, where the name of the tiny harbour and adjacent restaurant is Glada Laxen: the Laughing Salmon. When we ask manager Markku what their speciality is, he replies: “Perch.” We now know why the salmon is laughing.\nThe next archipelago is nestled between Finland and Sweden. Åland is officially Finnish, but Swedish is spoken. Again, you can opt for the wider channels that are used by the big ferries that ply the route between Helsinki, Turku, Mariehamn and Stockholm. Or you choose one of many narrower fairways between the smaller islands.\nIn a steady south-westerly breeze we sail from island to island before we reach Åland’s capital, Mariehamn, and finally complete our Gulf of Bothnia loop. But I’m not sure this chapter of our cruising is completely closed.\nIf you enjoyed this….\nYachting World is the world’s leading magazine for bluewater cruisers and offshore sailors.

In the case of Jean-François Delvoye, designer of the Boreal series of yachts, the vision is one of a resilient all-rounder.</p>\n<p>“I wanted to build a solid but performing boat, a voluminous all-rounder, comfortable at sea and at anchor. A fast boat, simple to use and maintain, which makes you feel at ease in Cowes harbour, the Polynesian lagoons, or even in the Screaming Fifties,” he explained.</p>\n<p>Boreal designs, built from aluminium in varying thicknesses, incorporate three watertight bulkheads, an icebreaker stem and a lifting keel. Both the prop and rudder are heavily protected, and the aluminium is unlikely to rupture if hit, providing a degree of protection in the event of being hit by a whale or container.</p>\n<p>Like most explorer yachts, the Boreal series is a product of utility, born to meet the demands of those more than happy to look beyond what can be offered at a much lower cost.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "As owners seek to sail more self-sufficiently, beat the depreciation associated with many production boats and explore off the beaten track, a yacht that’s very well built has become key for some buyers\n\nThose planning to sail to inhospitable places tend to have a strong vision of what is needed from the craft that will take them there. In the case of Jean-François Delvoye, designer of the Boreal series of yachts, the vision is one of a resilient all-rounder.\n“I wanted to build a solid but performing boat, a voluminous all-rounder, comfortable at sea and at anchor. A fast boat, simple to use and maintain, which makes you feel at ease in Cowes harbour, the Polynesian lagoons, or even in the Screaming Fifties,” he explained.\nBoreal designs, built from aluminium in varying thicknesses, incorporate three watertight bulkheads, an icebreaker stem and a lifting keel. Both the prop and rudder are heavily protected, and the aluminium is unlikely to rupture if hit, providing a degree of protection in the event of being hit by a whale or container.\nLike most explorer yachts, the Boreal series is a product of utility, born to meet the demands of those more than happy to look beyond what can be offered at a much lower cost. However, they are just one interpretation of what makes a ‘bulletproof’ yacht.\n\nThe S&S-designed Alpa 42 ketch is built of thick laminate GRP with an encapsulated lead keel.\n\nSurveyor’s choice\nNot all tough boats are built in metal. Whatever the hull material, a tough boat is likely to be built from a lot more of it. For those open to a GRP hull, construction varies enormously in quality and strength.\nBen Sutcliffe-Davies is a yacht surveyor of over 20 years’ experience and a trained boatbuilder. He looked for longevity and strength when buying his own yacht, as well as a boat that would be easy to maintain and with little to go wrong.\n“When it came to my own boat, I was looking for something that had many construction attributes hard to find in a modern yacht, that also sailed well. A Sparkman & Stephens design, the Alpa Nautica 42 is a ketch. The hull is of very thick solid laminate, she has a long, fully encapsulated keel, and a skeg hung rudder.\n\nStrong hull of the Boreal 47.2 can take the ground – note propeller protected by skeg\n\nThe keel ballast is lead, not iron, which will expand [if it rusts] and cause problems.\n“Internally, the frames are physically bonded into the hull. She is over 43 years old and still structurally good. While it’s perhaps not a fashionable boat, she sails well and, I think, is essentially bombproof. The weight of the hull is offset by her Sparkman & Stephens lines, sacrificing volume for seakeeping and speed.”\nBucking modern yacht design trends can be challenging for manufacturers. More voluminous hull shapes that can sacrifice heavy weather performance, unprotected twin rudders and sail drives, thinner GRP layup, deck stepped masts… there’s a long list of less-than-bulletproof design decisions that have proven popular with the wider market.\n\nThe Kraken Yachts ‘Zero Keel’ isn’t held on by bolts – it’s integral to the hull layup\n\nBuilding a ‘bulletproof’ yacht\nFor Dick Beaumont, not being able to find a tough boat led to him making his own, then starting a company building them.\n“I actually flew to the Düsseldorf boat show to help someone else find the right yacht for them and concluded there was nothing on the market that I would choose to go offshore in.\n“I had owned my Tayana 58, built in Taiwan, and knew I could find the expertise there to build something to my design. I then engaged Kevin Dibley, a New Zealand-based naval architect to work with me. This led to the formation of Kraken Yachts. We are now building from 44 to 66 feet.”\n\nYouTubers Sailing SV Delos have ordered a tough, custom-built explorer catamaran\n\nThe customer base for Kraken has proven to be quite specific. “We don’t advertise and we’re unapologetic about what we think really matters, so people tend to find their way to us.

But with a growing family and ambitions to cruise further afield, he and his wife Karin decided to not only make the move to a multihull but to build their own custom, tough catamaran.\nThere’s a growing number of ‘explorer cats’ being launched, many – like the new Delos – built in aluminium.

I just loved the teamwork aspect.</p>\n<p>“From there, we won the Youth Match Racing Nationals. That year, in 2000, the Youth Match Racing Worlds were in Auckland. We won, and our coach was Bill Edgerton. A week later, he was umpiring in the America’s Cup. So we went out in the umpire RIB with him, and watched the Louis Vuitton final between America One and Prada, which just blew my mind.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I remember they went downwind, overlapped the whole way, and [Paul] Cayard was screaming at his trimmer, trying to gybe to break and re-establish overlaps.

Ainslie was part of Team New Zealand, gaining insight into that squad – and them into him – both referred back to during the 2024 Cup.</p>\n<p>Briefly, it looked as if the British Olympic sailing powerhouse, combined with improved Cup experience, could combine to make a seriously competitive challenge.</p>\n<p>“On the back of the ‘07 Cup was when Sir Keith Mills started <a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/news/team-origin-out-of-americas-cup-7454\">Team Origin</a>, for the 33rd America’s Cup.</p>\n<p>“I genuinely think that was the best team I ever sailed with,” says Carr. “We took core talent out of Alinghi and Team New Zealand.</p>\n<p>“We had a sailing squad of 20 guys, six of which were America’s Cup Hall of Famers. We had this incredible afterguard with Ben [Ainslie] driving, Iain [Percy] doing tactics, and Bart [Andrew Simpson] doing strategy.</p>\n<p>“When Team Origin folded, because it was clear that we were going to go to a Deed of Gift match, I actually had a little cry because I knew that group would disband and not sail together again.

Carr recalls the stadium-style racing in <a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/multihull-guide\">multihulls</a> seemed like an enjoyable distraction at the time.</p>\n<p>“I’d never sailed a catamaran, but it sounded great fun. I joined it as a break away from traditional keel boat sailing. Then, six years later, it turned into <a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/americas-cup/worlds-coolest-yachts-ac45f-156376\">what the America’s Cup was</a>.</p>\n<p>“Luckily, I teamed up with Chris Draper on Oman Sail, and we went on to win the series in ‘09. A year later, all the Cup teams joined, and we were right in the thick of it.”</p>\n<p>With the Cup hurtling into its multihull era, good Extreme 40 crews found themselves in demand. “At the beginning of 2011, Prada announced they were going to [challenge for] the 34th America’s Cup. Myself and Chris joined Prada on the back of our Extreme Sailing Series win, to go and sail their World Series catamarans in 2012-13.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We ended up – amazingly – winning the America’s Cup World Series, which was my first taste of winning stuff in the Cup. And then we went on to sail the big catamarans in San Fran.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156648\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156648\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156648\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.gettyimages_173407084-630x355.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.gettyimages_173407084-630x355.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.gettyimages_173407084-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.gettyimages_173407084-1536x865.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.gettyimages_173407084.jpg 1890w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156648\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Team Luna Rossa’s AC72 in San Francisco in 2013.

For many, the Cup lost some of its allure after the tragedy.</p>\n<p>“Bart was [central] throughout my career so far,” recalls Carr. “He was the guy that said to me, ‘Look, you’re good, but you’re not going to be an Olympic sailor. You should look at match racing because I think you could be an amazing crew and team player.’</p>\n<p>“His death was a huge pivotal moment in safety around sailing. Sadly, it took that accident for us to wake up and see that we were miles behind in terms of safety protocols because the boats were just getting fast for the first time.</p>\n<p>“Whenever Ben and I have a beer we often reminisce about Bart, still. The day we won the Louis Vuitton final, afterwards a few of us were telling Bart stories. That’s how he sits with us all on the big days.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156638\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156638\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156638\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.150829_gothenburg_057-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.150829_gothenburg_057-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.150829_gothenburg_057-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.150829_gothenburg_057-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.150829_gothenburg_057.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156638\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Racing in the America’s Cup World Series at Gothenburg, Sweden.

Something [my wife] Bianca said stuck with me was ‘How would you feel if there was a British challenge, and they went on to win it?’ That was it. I spent the next year in a tiny office in Whiteley Business Park.</p>\n<p>“We had a sailing team of six that sailed this small test boat, T1, out of a tent in Southampton. Ben and <a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/features/10-women-doing-great-things-in-competitive-sailing-right-now-150800\">Jo Grindley</a> spent the best part of 2014 stomping the pavements of London, trying to drum up sponsorship, which they did unbelievably well. And by the end of 2015, we were fully funded in our big base in Portsmouth.”</p>\n<p>For Carr, the beginning of the 35th Cup also signalled the beginning of a brutal physical training regime, a workload he maintained for 10 years. It began with shedding 10kg in six months to join the BAR squad.</p>\n<p>He went on to compete in two Cup cycles as a grinder, endlessly spinning a pedestal winch to produce hydraulic power, before pivoting to become a cyclor. It required a total shift from the old-school ‘big boat’ mentality.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156641\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156641\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156641\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.200204_teamineosuk_lloydimages_023_1_396606332_684681931-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.200204_teamineosuk_lloydimages_023_1_396606332_684681931-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.200204_teamineosuk_lloydimages_023_1_396606332_684681931-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.200204_teamineosuk_lloydimages_023_1_396606332_684681931-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.200204_teamineosuk_lloydimages_023_1_396606332_684681931.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156641\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">INEOS winter training in Cagliari, Italy.

I’ve loved setting myself targets outside sailing that give me a bit of motivation to go the extra mile.</p>\n<p>“We get fitness tested every quarter within the Cup world, so that’s my job. But I decided to make fitness my hobby as well, to run ultra-duathlons and marathons. I rowed at the British Indoor Rowing Championship. I did bike races as soon as the Cup went into cycling.</p>\n<p>“The way I’ve always looked at it is how lucky am I to be getting paid to be fit and healthy?”</p>\n<p>“But my God, it’s hard,” he admits. “In the last two years, I was so glad we moved away from grinding into a hydraulic pump, because my shoulders and my wrists would not stop clicking. My shoulders had given up the ghost after 20 years.”</p>\n<p>With the 37th Cup came a shift to hours instead on a bike, but Carr was also working hard to hold back the years. He pledged to team boss Ainslie that he’d hit the team’s fitness benchmark on his 40th birthday.</p>\n<p>“I gave myself four months to get that number.

I was the fittest lad back then, and I would really enjoy beating the others. Now I’m at the other end of the scale where I was just so happy to be hanging onto these lads’ coats tails for this last cycle.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’ve had to really adjust my psyche. I’ve gone from trying to be an alpha male, to just trying to beat myself every day.”</p>\n<p>The training regime was just the start. In the heat of battle – literally – the cyclors had one of the toughest physical challenges in sailing. “The environment that we’re operating in is not pleasant,” Carr said with some understatement.</p>\n<p>Racing over the sweltering Barcelona summer, the cyclors deliberately lowered their core body temperature by wearing ice vests, drinking frozen slushies and dousing their skin with alcoholic sprays. “You want to get onto the boat shivering,” explained Carr. Their core temperature would rise by 4 degrees to over 40°C over the course of a race.</p>\n<p>“We’re loaded into a little carbon box with no airflow and have to maintain clarity of thought to help get this boat around the course, while getting shaken around.”</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156643\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156643\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156643\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.cauldphoto_Ineos_dectrainingcamp_3515-630x355.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.cauldphoto_Ineos_dectrainingcamp_3515-630x355.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.cauldphoto_Ineos_dectrainingcamp_3515-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.cauldphoto_Ineos_dectrainingcamp_3515-1536x865.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/02/YAW305.profile_freddie_carr.cauldphoto_Ineos_dectrainingcamp_3515.jpg 1890w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156643\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Riding with the INEOS Grenadiers cycling team.

You can take all of these visual clues, and that human interaction where you can build energy. In Version 2 of the 75s, we’re each in our individual pods. And that’s been hard for me.</p>\n<p>“But actually the skill in being a cyclor is knowing when not to max out. It’s about recognising that you’ve just tacked off on the right-hand boundary, and you’re on a right shift. So you’re going to be on that daggerboard for 90 seconds. You trim back down, settle the boat. You’ve then got 45 seconds where we can return to baseline and suck up some oxygen.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And that’s the skill. In recognising when not to be at max heart rate, so when you arrive at the windward mark, you can really put some watts down.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "David ‘Freddie’ Carr has spent two decades trying to win the America’s Cup for Britain, he tells Helen Fretter how the game’s changed\n\n“For 23 years I have had the privilege to call myself an America’s Cup sailor, but today is the last day of that for me. The body says it’s time to stop. I am done,” wrote David Carr – or Freddie, as everyone knows him – on 19 October this year.\nThe day INEOS Britannia bowed out of the 37th America’s Cup as Emirates Team New Zealand took victory marked the end of the third consecutive British campaign, and almost 10 years of trying (the British team did vow to continue on, though a recent high profile split has called into question the future of the British challenge).\nThough for Freddie, and many others in Barcelona last summer, it has been a much longer process even that that.\nCarr did not come from the Olympic pathway, as many Cup sailors do, but from crewing in dinghies he moved to match racing, and began a livelong love affair with the America’s Cup. “I was a reasonable Laser sailor, but never going to set the world on fire,” he recalls.\n“When I was 15, I started sailing with Mark Campbell-James in First Class 8s, doing the match racing circuit around Europe. I just loved the teamwork aspect.\n“From there, we won the Youth Match Racing Nationals. That year, in 2000, the Youth Match Racing Worlds were in Auckland. We won, and our coach was Bill Edgerton. A week later, he was umpiring in the America’s Cup. So we went out in the umpire RIB with him, and watched the Louis Vuitton final between America One and Prada, which just blew my mind.\n“I remember they went downwind, overlapped the whole way, and [Paul] Cayard was screaming at his trimmer, trying to gybe to break and re-establish overlaps. I was only 17 at the time, and I just thought, ‘This is the coolest thing ever.’”\n\n‘The collective effort that had to be put in every day to get faster, I’m just so proud of that’. Photo: Ricardo Pinto/America’s Cup\n\nNipper’s induction\nFollowing the 2000 Cup, Sir Peter Harrison launched his GBR Challenge, with Ian Walker as team boss.\n“I called him up and said, ‘Look, I just want to come and help. I’ve got a year off, I don’t want to get paid.’ I went there as the absolute nipper, the lowest of the low. I had the worst jobs you could imagine,” he recalls, including painstaking hours peeling stickers from sails inherited from other teams.\n“But eventually, I got on the RIB, then I got on the boat. That summer, it was the America’s Cup Jubilee. We raced Prada and Team New Zealand, and that was me hooked.\n“Then we travelled down to Auckland for 2003. I was learning from the very best British yachtsmen, guys who were probably on the forefront of professional sailing.\n“I was getting NZ$500 a month, which at the time was about £180. I was working seven days a week, 14 hours a day, but I just didn’t care.\n“When people ask ‘What set you up to be where you are today?’ That was it. Those two years working with Simon Fry, James Stagg, Ian Walker, Ado Stead… all of them. I’m so grateful to that generation for teaching me so well.”\n\nGBR Challenge, Britain’s entry for the 2002 America’s Cup. Photo: Clive Mason/Allsport/Getty\n\nFreddie’s apprenticeship wasn’t only in sailing. As the youngest and, by his own admission, one of the most annoying members of the team, he also got a thorough induction into British sporting culture.\n“I’ve always had a bit of a sharp wit on me. But I definitely over-stepped the mark and wound up the old guys. If I was particularly cheeky, they’d put me in a spinnaker bag and hoist me up into the roof and then hit me with inflatable battens like I was a pinata!\n“Every time I was walking down the dock at the end of the day, I would get pushed in the water. I was the team whipping boy, but there is a really fun Mickey-taking culture in all sports teams.\n“I’ve always said to the new lads [in INEOS Britannia], it’s when I’m not taking the p*ss out of you is when you’re in trouble. When British people are taking the Mickey out of you, you’re loved and liked.”\n\nBritain’s proposed Challenge for the 33rd Cup, Team Origin.

Ainslie was part of Team New Zealand, gaining insight into that squad – and them into him – both referred back to during the 2024 Cup.\nBriefly, it looked as if the British Olympic sailing powerhouse, combined with improved Cup experience, could combine to make a seriously competitive challenge.\n“On the back of the ‘07 Cup was when Sir Keith Mills started Team Origin, for the 33rd America’s Cup.\n“I genuinely think that was the best team I ever sailed with,” says Carr. “We took core talent out of Alinghi and Team New Zealand.\n“We had a sailing squad of 20 guys, six of which were America’s Cup Hall of Famers. We had this incredible afterguard with Ben [Ainslie] driving, Iain [Percy] doing tactics, and Bart [Andrew Simpson] doing strategy.\n“When Team Origin folded, because it was clear that we were going to go to a Deed of Gift match, I actually had a little cry because I knew that group would disband and not sail together again. So whenever I look back at my America’s Cup career, that’s the one that got away.”\n\nWinning the iShares Cup with Oman Sail’s Extreme 40 catamaran Masira – and gaining invaluable experience for when the America’s Cup turned to multihulls. Photo: Thierry Martinez/Sea&Co\n\nMultihull experiment\nWith the prospect of another British Cup bid faltering, Carr was among the diverse group of sailors who jumped into the Extreme Sailing Series. Carr recalls the stadium-style racing in multihulls seemed like an enjoyable distraction at the time.\n“I’d never sailed a catamaran, but it sounded great fun. I joined it as a break away from traditional keel boat sailing. Then, six years later, it turned into what the America’s Cup was.\n“Luckily, I teamed up with Chris Draper on Oman Sail, and we went on to win the series in ‘09. A year later, all the Cup teams joined, and we were right in the thick of it.”\nWith the Cup hurtling into its multihull era, good Extreme 40 crews found themselves in demand. “At the beginning of 2011, Prada announced they were going to [challenge for] the 34th America’s Cup. Myself and Chris joined Prada on the back of our Extreme Sailing Series win, to go and sail their World Series catamarans in 2012-13.\n“We ended up – amazingly – winning the America’s Cup World Series, which was my first taste of winning stuff in the Cup. And then we went on to sail the big catamarans in San Fran.”\n\nTeam Luna Rossa’s AC72 in San Francisco in 2013.

For many, the Cup lost some of its allure after the tragedy.\n“Bart was [central] throughout my career so far,” recalls Carr. “He was the guy that said to me, ‘Look, you’re good, but you’re not going to be an Olympic sailor. You should look at match racing because I think you could be an amazing crew and team player.’\n“His death was a huge pivotal moment in safety around sailing. Sadly, it took that accident for us to wake up and see that we were miles behind in terms of safety protocols because the boats were just getting fast for the first time.\n“Whenever Ben and I have a beer we often reminisce about Bart, still. The day we won the Louis Vuitton final, afterwards a few of us were telling Bart stories. That’s how he sits with us all on the big days.”\n\nRacing in the America’s Cup World Series at Gothenburg, Sweden. Photo: Mark Lloyd/Lloyd Images\n\nFlying the flag\nAfter Oracle Team USA’s astonishing comeback win in San Francisco, with Ainslie calling tactics, the door reopened for a British bid for the 35th Cup.\n“I had a conversation with Ben where he said, ‘Look, Freds, there’s a chance that we could get a British Challenger off the ground here.’ But I’d re-signed to go with Luna Rossa, I’d be giving up a guaranteed thing.\n“I ummed and ahhed about it for a while. Something [my wife] Bianca said stuck with me was ‘How would you feel if there was a British challenge, and they went on to win it?’ That was it. I spent the next year in a tiny office in Whiteley Business Park.\n“We had a sailing team of six that sailed this small test boat, T1, out of a tent in Southampton. Ben and Jo Grindley spent the best part of 2014 stomping the pavements of London, trying to drum up sponsorship, which they did unbelievably well. And by the end of 2015, we were fully funded in our big base in Portsmouth.”\nFor Carr, the beginning of the 35th Cup also signalled the beginning of a brutal physical training regime, a workload he maintained for 10 years. It began with shedding 10kg in six months to join the BAR squad.\nHe went on to compete in two Cup cycles as a grinder, endlessly spinning a pedestal winch to produce hydraulic power, before pivoting to become a cyclor. It required a total shift from the old-school ‘big boat’ mentality.\n\nINEOS winter training in Cagliari, Italy. Photo: Mark Lloyd/Lloyd Images\n\n“In the last 15 years I’ve been on a total fitness and health journey, and I really value what it’s done to my mental and physical well-being. I’ve loved setting myself targets outside sailing that give me a bit of motivation to go the extra mile.\n“We get fitness tested every quarter within the Cup world, so that’s my job. But I decided to make fitness my hobby as well, to run ultra-duathlons and marathons. I rowed at the British Indoor Rowing Championship. I did bike races as soon as the Cup went into cycling.\n“The way I’ve always looked at it is how lucky am I to be getting paid to be fit and healthy?”\n“But my God, it’s hard,” he admits. “In the last two years, I was so glad we moved away from grinding into a hydraulic pump, because my shoulders and my wrists would not stop clicking. My shoulders had given up the ghost after 20 years.”\nWith the 37th Cup came a shift to hours instead on a bike, but Carr was also working hard to hold back the years. He pledged to team boss Ainslie that he’d hit the team’s fitness benchmark on his 40th birthday.\n“I gave myself four months to get that number. I trained like a pro cyclist, and I was a misery to live with! But I got the number.\n\nCyclor training required hours on static and road bikes. Photo: Cameron Gregory/INEOS Britannia\n\n“It’s certainly been harder training for this cycle than the previous ones. When I was with BAR, I could do hard session after hard session. I was the fittest lad back then, and I would really enjoy beating the others. Now I’m at the other end of the scale where I was just so happy to be hanging onto these lads’ coats tails for this last cycle.\n“I’ve had to really adjust my psyche. I’ve gone from trying to be an alpha male, to just trying to beat myself every day.”\nThe training regime was just the start. In the heat of battle – literally – the cyclors had one of the toughest physical challenges in sailing. “The environment that we’re operating in is not pleasant,” Carr said with some understatement.\nRacing over the sweltering Barcelona summer, the cyclors deliberately lowered their core body temperature by wearing ice vests, drinking frozen slushies and dousing their skin with alcoholic sprays. “You want to get onto the boat shivering,” explained Carr. Their core temperature would rise by 4 degrees to over 40°C over the course of a race.\n“We’re loaded into a little carbon box with no airflow and have to maintain clarity of thought to help get this boat around the course, while getting shaken around.”\n\nRiding with the INEOS Grenadiers cycling team. Photo: Chris Auld Photography\n\nTo make it even harder, each grinder is operating in near isolation. “Even in the first version of the AC75s, we were in a trench with human contact.\n“I could look down my line of grinders and get a head nod, or I could see where Ben was turning the wheel. You can take all of these visual clues, and that human interaction where you can build energy. In Version 2 of the 75s, we’re each in our individual pods. And that’s been hard for me.\n“But actually the skill in being a cyclor is knowing when not to max out. It’s about recognising that you’ve just tacked off on the right-hand boundary, and you’re on a right shift. So you’re going to be on that daggerboard for 90 seconds. You trim back down, settle the boat. You’ve then got 45 seconds where we can return to baseline and suck up some oxygen.\n“And that’s the skill. In recognising when not to be at max heart rate, so when you arrive at the windward mark, you can really put some watts down. That’s one of the biggest things we had to teach the rowers, because they’ve drilled their whole lives to go and rail it!”\nCarr was one of two squads of cyclors which the INEOS Britannia team rotated, including switching out their custom-fit ‘bike’ seats and frames between races. The last race he took part in was on 16 October, the day Britain took two America’s Cup race wins against Emirates Team New Zealand. It was a moment he says 17 year-old teenage Carr in Auckland would never have believed.\n\nINEOS Britannia battling it out with Emirates Team New Zealand off Barcelona during Race 7 of the 37th America’s Cup.

From the end of the prelims to the end of the Louis Vuitton final, the collective effort that close to 150 people had to put in every day to get faster, I’m just so proud of that.\n“And it was harder than I ever thought it would be. I still don’t think I’ve quite got my head around the effort that was required to get us to the Match.”\nIn the immediate future, Carr will be swapping clip-in cycling shoes for more conventional sailing boots. “I’m going to go actual sailing – TP sailing, Mini Maxi sailing. I’m not going to go cycling on a boat at 55 knots!\n“But I’m still going to stay involved in the Cup. What that looks like, I don’t quite know yet. I would love to stay involved with the British Challenge and help bring on the next generation of sailors into this world because I think I’ve got a pretty unique set of skills that can help that.\n“There’s absolutely no way I can walk away from this thing that has been my life for 20 years.”\nIf you enjoyed this….\nYachting World is the world’s leading magazine for bluewater cruisers and offshore sailors.

But on all my <a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/voyages\">voyages</a> the golden rule has been to know what NOT to do. I learned that valuable lesson on my very first day on a sailing yacht.</p>\n<p>At the time I was working at the BBC World Service and the BBC yacht club had a 40ft sloop called Ariel based on the Hamble. I signed up for a sailing weekend along with a friend from television news called Charlie McLaren. We travelled down on Friday, met the captain and sailed to the <a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/tag/round-the-island-race\">Isle of Wight</a>, planning to spend the night at Yarmouth. As we neared the island, the captain told Charlie, who was the mate for the weekend, to get the crew to lower the sails.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156601\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156601\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156601\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.dsc05696-630x354.png\" alt=\"A tropical view with a yacht\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.dsc05696-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.dsc05696-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.dsc05696-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.dsc05696.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156601\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">‘At any given moment there are 10,000 boats undertaking a long voyage.’ Photo: Dan Bower/World ARC</p></div>\n<p>Suddenly there was a loud crunch and Ariel came to an abrupt halt. Even I could tell that we’d run aground. The boat was heeling over at an angle and rocking in the swell. Then, while lowering the mainsail, the wildly swinging boom hit the other crew hard on the head, the violent blow splitting his scalp open.</p>\n<p>With blood gushing all over the place, we took him below and put a towel around his head. Charlie offered to make him a cup of tea, but as he was pouring the water into a mug, the grounded yacht gave a sudden lurch and the boiling water all splashed into his sea boots.</p>\n<p>Screaming like mad, Charlie ripped his boots off, yet by the time he’d pulled off his woollen socks both legs were already covered in blisters.</p>\n<p>With the situation now bordering on the desperate, and no prospect of getting afloat on our own, the captain hailed a passing motoryacht and asked them to pull us off, which they did. He then contacted the Coastguard by VHF and was told to head back to Portsmouth, where the hospital had an A&amp;E department.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156596\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156596\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156596\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.arc2023_leonardo_pazzaglia_save_20231214_121216_01-630x354.png\" alt=\"Classic cruising in an Atlantic crossing with the ARC. \" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.arc2023_leonardo_pazzaglia_save_20231214_121216_01-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.arc2023_leonardo_pazzaglia_save_20231214_121216_01-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.arc2023_leonardo_pazzaglia_save_20231214_121216_01-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.arc2023_leonardo_pazzaglia_save_20231214_121216_01.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156596\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Classic cruising in an Atlantic crossing with the ARC.

I bade goodbye to the captain and took the train back to London. “How was your weekend?” asked my wife Gwenda when I got home.</p>\n<p>“Very interesting. I think I’ve learned a lot,” I told her. “Not much about sailing, but a lot about what NOT to do on a boat.”</p>\n<p>Over the years I came to realise that learning what not to do fully accords with the ruling principles of voyage planning. The primary objective is to plan a route or passage that takes best advantage of prevailing winds and favourable seasons. Essentially that’s about always being in the right place at the right time, or, better still, not being in the wrong place at the wrong time!</p>\n<p>According to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, ‘Voyage planning is common sense’.

The vast majority of those adventures have a happy ending. Bearing in mind the many challenges that sailors on ambitious voyages have to overcome, it is quite remarkable how there are relatively few failures.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156594\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156594\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156594\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.2rgp675-630x354.png\" alt=\"South Pacific sailing paradise – Mo’orea in French Polynesia. \" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.2rgp675-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.2rgp675-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.2rgp675-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.2rgp675.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156594\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">South Pacific sailing paradise – Mo’orea in French Polynesia.

These are: the boat itself; problems with the crew; an inability to be self-sufficient; inadequate funds; or having the wrong attitude to life at sea.</p>\n<p>These are such important matters for anyone planning a long voyage that I conducted several surveys among long distance sailors, as well as participants in my rallies, to find out more about those causes.</p>\n<p><em>Article continues below&#8230;</em></p>\n\n\n<div id=\"accordion\" class=\"collection-wrapper list-large \">\n\n\t\t\t\t<article class=\"loop loop-list-large row post-151194 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-cruising category-voyages tag-round-the-world tag-top-stories publication_name-yachting-world loop-even loop-14 featured-image\" role=\"article\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 entry-media\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/cruising/how-to-sail-around-the-world-launching-an-epic-adventure-151194\" rel=\"bookmark\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1890\" height=\"1063\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/04/wdjhwj.jpg\" class=\" wp-post-image\" alt=\"An aerial shot of a yacht in a tropical sea\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/04/wdjhwj.jpg 1890w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/04/wdjhwj-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/04/wdjhwj-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/04/wdjhwj-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1890px) 100vw, 1890px\" data-image-id=\"151210\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/cruising/how-to-sail-around-the-world-launching-an-epic-adventure-151194\" rel=\"bookmark\">How to sail around the world: Launching an epic adventure</a></h2>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</header>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\n                            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Personal preparations and sailing skills are still the biggest part of planning to sail around the world.  Knowledge and competence&hellip;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</article>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<article class=\"loop loop-list-large row post-145717 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-voyages tag-adventure tag-liveaboard tag-top-stories publication_name-yachting-world loop-even loop-14 featured-image\" role=\"article\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 entry-media\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/voyages/swimming-with-humpback-whales-145717\" rel=\"bookmark\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2023/05/YAW285.FEAT_Swim_with_whales.yw_whale_article_50.jpg\" class=\" wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2023/05/YAW285.FEAT_Swim_with_whales.yw_whale_article_50.jpg 2000w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2023/05/YAW285.FEAT_Swim_with_whales.yw_whale_article_50-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2023/05/YAW285.FEAT_Swim_with_whales.yw_whale_article_50-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2023/05/YAW285.FEAT_Swim_with_whales.yw_whale_article_50-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" data-image-id=\"145727\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/voyages/swimming-with-humpback-whales-145717\" rel=\"bookmark\">Swimming with humpback whales</a></h2>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</header>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\n                            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>“Slip into the water, don’t jump.

But when it came to the financial aspect, the early part of my first voyage was quite difficult as we’d spent all our money on the boat, and had absolutely no savings.</p>\n<p>However, although I had resigned from my job at the BBC, I was asked to send back reports on any subject of interest that I might come across. Most of my reports were sent to a programme called Hello Tomorrow, which dealt with developing countries. The programme was produced by the BBC World Service and sent to radio stations around the world. Often an interview that I’d recorded at a previous stop had already been broadcast in the country where we had just arrived.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156591\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156591\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156591\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/PBO284.cover_.jimmy_on_avetura_zero_2-630x354.png\" alt=\"Cornell at the wheel of Aventura Zero, the bespoke Outremer 45 he planned to sail round the world using only electric power without having to rely on any fossil fuels\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/PBO284.cover_.jimmy_on_avetura_zero_2-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/PBO284.cover_.jimmy_on_avetura_zero_2-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/PBO284.cover_.jimmy_on_avetura_zero_2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/PBO284.cover_.jimmy_on_avetura_zero_2.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156591\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cornell at the wheel of Aventura Zero, the bespoke Outremer 45 he planned to sail round the world using only electric power without having to rely on any fossil fuels.

Besides providing us with a modest, but regular income, my work provided an excellent opportunity to meet interesting people in every country we stopped.</p>\n<p>The financial aspect of long-distance cruising is now very different from when it was still possible to do it on a limited budget. My advice on cruising budgets is to be prepared for the costs to be higher than expected, and to have recourse to some reserve funds in a serious emergency.</p>\n<p>I’d also urge everyone to think carefully before making a clean break with shore life during the current economic uncertainty, creeping inflation and currency fluctuations. If possible, you should keep a shore base in case you are forced to change plans, whether for health or financial reasons, to have somewhere to return to.</p>\n<h2>Build routines</h2>\n<p>Sailing with our two young children on the first voyage imposed on us a certain discipline. We established a routine with regular meals, schoolwork, rest periods and watches, a pattern that continued even when I was not sailing with my family.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156608\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156608\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156608\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.sebastian_gylling_eb76b8d5_9a15_4ab2_9e56_dcc8ef16f7c3-630x354.png\" alt=\"Crew compatibility and their attitude to the voyage are vital for a stress-free adventure.\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.sebastian_gylling_eb76b8d5_9a15_4ab2_9e56_dcc8ef16f7c3-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.sebastian_gylling_eb76b8d5_9a15_4ab2_9e56_dcc8ef16f7c3-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.sebastian_gylling_eb76b8d5_9a15_4ab2_9e56_dcc8ef16f7c3-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.sebastian_gylling_eb76b8d5_9a15_4ab2_9e56_dcc8ef16f7c3.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156608\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Crew compatibility and their attitude to the voyage are vital for a stress-free adventure. Photo: Sebastian Gylling/ARC</p></div>\n<p>There were other rules that became routine, such as always checking the anchor with a mask if we were spending any length of time in an anchorage. Some of my later crew found my insistence on a regular routine as pedantic and at odds with their expectations of a cruising life. In most cases, they had joined me for a limited time and were looking forward to a nice and enjoyable vacation.</p>\n<p>They were irritated by such onboard routines as keeping regular watches, being quiet when the off watch crew were sleeping, or not having unlimited use of fresh water. I realised that it was not the routines they could not accept, but the concept of discipline.</p>\n<h2>Stay flexible</h2>\n<p>Having done all my early sailing at a time when there were no weather forecasts available on ocean passages, my offshore tactics had to be based on the actual conditions being experienced. This is how I learned the importance of being flexible when it came to route planning.</p>\n<p>Seizing a potentially promising opportunity had always been my attitude and this is how our planned three-year world voyage on the first Aventura ended up lasting twice as long. Looking back on that voyage, and those on the following four Aventuras, I realise that some of the most memorable highlights of my sailing were thanks to those unforeseen detours.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156604\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156604\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156604\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.l536386-630x354.png\" alt=\"What it’s all about – incredible sailing in the world’s most spectacular locations\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.l536386-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.l536386-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.l536386-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.l536386.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156604\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">What it’s all about – incredible sailing in the world’s most spectacular locations.

When I told him I was a journalist and working for the BBC, he asked whether we were planning to sail to the Ellice Islands for the forthcoming independence celebrations. He painted a very tempting picture of the planned festivities, and I was hooked on the idea.</p>\n<p>So rather than continue west, as planned, towards Australia, from Fiji we turned north and witnessed the birth of Tuvalu, the smallest independent nation in the world. During the independence festivities, I met Ieremia Tabai, chief minister of the neighbouring Gilbert Islands, and future president of Kiribati, who invited us to come to their own celebrations the following year.</p>\n<p>By now we were so seduced by the South Pacific and its people that we decided to spend as long as possible there instead of rushing west to complete the second half of our circumnavigation.</p>\n<p>From Tuvalu, we sailed south to New Zealand to avoid the cyclone season. The following year we returned to the tropics, and from Tonga sailed north, crossed the equator and eventually made landfall at Tarawa, the capital of Kiribati.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156597\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156597\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156597\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.aventura_iii_at_romance_glacier_chile-630x354.png\" alt=\"Aventura III at Romanche Glacier in Chile. \" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.aventura_iii_at_romance_glacier_chile-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.aventura_iii_at_romance_glacier_chile-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.aventura_iii_at_romance_glacier_chile-1536x863.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.aventura_iii_at_romance_glacier_chile.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156597\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Aventura III at Romanche Glacier in Chile. Photo: Jimmy Cornell</p></div>\n<p>Similarly, after the launch of Aventura III in 1998, my planned round the world voyage started with an expedition to Antarctica, accompanied by my son, Ivan But on our return we decided that rather than continue west, we’d sail north all the way to Alaska.</p>\n<p>The unplanned detour started with a leisurely cruise through the spectacular Chilean fjordland, a wonderland of ever-changing scenery, with sparkling glaciers, tumbling waterfalls, and countless sheltered anchorages. On a stretch of 600 miles, there was not one single settlement, not even a house, and we met only four cruising boats and about as many fishing boats.</p>\n<p>From Chile we continued to Easter Island and Pitcairn, both of which we’d visited 22 years previously. But we took our time to call at places that we’d missed in the past: the Austral and Line Islands, as well as Hawaii and Alaska. Aventura III’s tortuous world voyage was eventually completed 12 years later.</p>\n<p>My willingness to change plans and take detours is probably explained by my being open-minded whenever I am faced with an option that looks challenging but has the potential of richer rewards.</p>\n<h2>Pick crew carefully</h2>\n<p>After that first voyage, whenever possible I sailed with Gwenda, or my children Doina or Ivan. When they could not join me, I had no choice but to take on crew. It was not long before I discovered that the crew problems I’d witnessed on other boats were now affecting me as well.</p>\n<p>On a few occasions, I was disappointed to discover that even old friends behaved differently on the boat than ashore. Some of the worst were those who had their own boats and some offshore experience but were unable to accept my role of captain. This sad experience was obviously not unusual, and I realised that’s the reason why the majority of cruising boats are sailed by couples on their own.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156605\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156605\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156605\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.london_departure_april_1975-630x354.png\" alt=\"Cornell and the first Aventura depart London in 1975.\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.london_departure_april_1975-630x354.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.london_departure_april_1975-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.london_departure_april_1975-1536x864.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.london_departure_april_1975.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156605\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cornell and the first Aventura depart London in 1975. Photo: Jimmy Cornell</p></div>\n<p>There must be some truth in Hemingway’s advice that “one should only sail with people you love”. The risk of having problems with occasional crew is virtually impossible to avoid because in most cases they happen after the passage has started.</p>\n<p>This is one of the reasons why I always advised participants in the ARC to set an initial course to the Caribbean that passed close to the Cape Verde islands, not only because they would encounter better winds from there on but mainly because it gave them the opportunity to stop and get rid of a difficult crew.

Leaving on a sailing yacht just because it is a convenient way to see the world is not a good enough reason.

The ultimate success of a voyage does not depend on the boat, finances or crew but on you and your attitude.</p>\n<p>Having the right attitude is as difficult to define as having common sense. You either have it or you don’t. Life at sea can be difficult, uncomfortable, occasionally hard and dangerous. You must be physically in good shape and psychologically able to deal with the demands of a challenging existence. Before committing yourself to a long voyage, it would be advisable to do a short ocean passage to decide whether that’s the kind of life you’d enjoy.</p>\n<p>In my 50 years of sailing I’ve met many outstanding people, and invariably what made them stand out was their attitude. What I most admired in them was their profound respect for the sea.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156599\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156599\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156599\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.aventura_zero_2-630x355.png\" alt=\"All-electric Aventura Zero\" width=\"630\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.aventura_zero_2-630x355.png 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.aventura_zero_2-300x169.png 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.aventura_zero_2-1536x865.png 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.FEAT_cornell_lifetime.aventura_zero_2.png 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156599\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">All-electric Aventura Zero.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Cruising doyen Jimmy Cornell on how to avoid pitfalls, and make your cruising adventure a true trip of a lifetime.\nPhoto: Ugo Fonolla/Oyster World Rally\nWhen it comes to regrets, I have none. But on all my voyages the golden rule has been to know what NOT to do. I learned that valuable lesson on my very first day on a sailing yacht.\nAt the time I was working at the BBC World Service and the BBC yacht club had a 40ft sloop called Ariel based on the Hamble. I signed up for a sailing weekend along with a friend from television news called Charlie McLaren. We travelled down on Friday, met the captain and sailed to the Isle of Wight, planning to spend the night at Yarmouth. As we neared the island, the captain told Charlie, who was the mate for the weekend, to get the crew to lower the sails.\n\n‘At any given moment there are 10,000 boats undertaking a long voyage.’ Photo: Dan Bower/World ARC\n\nSuddenly there was a loud crunch and Ariel came to an abrupt halt. Even I could tell that we’d run aground. The boat was heeling over at an angle and rocking in the swell. Then, while lowering the mainsail, the wildly swinging boom hit the other crew hard on the head, the violent blow splitting his scalp open.\nWith blood gushing all over the place, we took him below and put a towel around his head. Charlie offered to make him a cup of tea, but as he was pouring the water into a mug, the grounded yacht gave a sudden lurch and the boiling water all splashed into his sea boots.\nScreaming like mad, Charlie ripped his boots off, yet by the time he’d pulled off his woollen socks both legs were already covered in blisters.\nWith the situation now bordering on the desperate, and no prospect of getting afloat on our own, the captain hailed a passing motoryacht and asked them to pull us off, which they did. He then contacted the Coastguard by VHF and was told to head back to Portsmouth, where the hospital had an A&E department.\n\nClassic cruising in an Atlantic crossing with the ARC. Photo: Leonardo Pazzaglia/ARC\n\nWe motored across the busy Solent waterway, and saw an ambulance with its blue lights flashing waiting for us. I bade goodbye to the captain and took the train back to London. “How was your weekend?” asked my wife Gwenda when I got home.\n“Very interesting. I think I’ve learned a lot,” I told her. “Not much about sailing, but a lot about what NOT to do on a boat.”\nOver the years I came to realise that learning what not to do fully accords with the ruling principles of voyage planning. The primary objective is to plan a route or passage that takes best advantage of prevailing winds and favourable seasons. Essentially that’s about always being in the right place at the right time, or, better still, not being in the wrong place at the wrong time!\nAccording to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, ‘Voyage planning is common sense’. The definition of common sense is the basic level of practical knowledge and judgement that we all need to help us live and travel in a reasonable and safe way.\n\nCornell has sailed many ways around the world, from the Northwest Passage (inset) to the Antarctic. Photo: Jimmy Cornell\n\nAvoiding pitfalls\nFor the last 35 years I have kept a record of the global movement of sailing yachts based on the number of arrivals in key locations around the world (see full feature in the October 2023 issue of Yachting World and at yachtingworld.com).\nWorldwide it is estimated that at any given moment there are around 10,000 boats undertaking a long voyage. The vast majority of those adventures have a happy ending. Bearing in mind the many challenges that sailors on ambitious voyages have to overcome, it is quite remarkable how there are relatively few failures.\n\nSouth Pacific sailing paradise – Mo’orea in French Polynesia. Photo: Cavan Images/Alamy\n\nFrom the cases of unhappy or abandoned voyages that have come to my knowledge over the years, and from conversations with owners and crews, I narrowed down the most common factors that contribute to the ‘failure’ of a voyage. These are: the boat itself; problems with the crew; an inability to be self-sufficient; inadequate funds; or having the wrong attitude to life at sea.\nThese are such important matters for anyone planning a long voyage that I conducted several surveys among long distance sailors, as well as participants in my rallies, to find out more about those causes.\nArticle continues below…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nHow to sail around the world: Launching an epic adventure\nPersonal preparations and sailing skills are still the biggest part of planning to sail around the world.  Knowledge and competence…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSwimming with humpback whales\n“Slip into the water, don’t jump. Try not to splash, and follow me,” our guide Torea hurriedly told us as…\n\n\nManaging finances\nApplying those criteria to my own experience, the choice of my various boats has been generally right, and every one of them fulfilled my expectations. But when it came to the financial aspect, the early part of my first voyage was quite difficult as we’d spent all our money on the boat, and had absolutely no savings.\nHowever, although I had resigned from my job at the BBC, I was asked to send back reports on any subject of interest that I might come across. Most of my reports were sent to a programme called Hello Tomorrow, which dealt with developing countries. The programme was produced by the BBC World Service and sent to radio stations around the world. Often an interview that I’d recorded at a previous stop had already been broadcast in the country where we had just arrived.\n\nCornell at the wheel of Aventura Zero, the bespoke Outremer 45 he planned to sail round the world using only electric power without having to rely on any fossil fuels. Photo: Jimmy Cornell\n\nThis made my task much easier and I had no problem finding new material everywhere: visiting an experimental farming station in the jungle of Panama; the Potato Institute in the Peruvian Andes; or a tea plantation in the highlands of Sri Lanka. Besides providing us with a modest, but regular income, my work provided an excellent opportunity to meet interesting people in every country we stopped.\nThe financial aspect of long-distance cruising is now very different from when it was still possible to do it on a limited budget. My advice on cruising budgets is to be prepared for the costs to be higher than expected, and to have recourse to some reserve funds in a serious emergency.\nI’d also urge everyone to think carefully before making a clean break with shore life during the current economic uncertainty, creeping inflation and currency fluctuations. If possible, you should keep a shore base in case you are forced to change plans, whether for health or financial reasons, to have somewhere to return to.\nBuild routines\nSailing with our two young children on the first voyage imposed on us a certain discipline. We established a routine with regular meals, schoolwork, rest periods and watches, a pattern that continued even when I was not sailing with my family.\n\nCrew compatibility and their attitude to the voyage are vital for a stress-free adventure. Photo: Sebastian Gylling/ARC\n\nThere were other rules that became routine, such as always checking the anchor with a mask if we were spending any length of time in an anchorage. Some of my later crew found my insistence on a regular routine as pedantic and at odds with their expectations of a cruising life. In most cases, they had joined me for a limited time and were looking forward to a nice and enjoyable vacation.\nThey were irritated by such onboard routines as keeping regular watches, being quiet when the off watch crew were sleeping, or not having unlimited use of fresh water. I realised that it was not the routines they could not accept, but the concept of discipline.\nStay flexible\nHaving done all my early sailing at a time when there were no weather forecasts available on ocean passages, my offshore tactics had to be based on the actual conditions being experienced. This is how I learned the importance of being flexible when it came to route planning.\nSeizing a potentially promising opportunity had always been my attitude and this is how our planned three-year world voyage on the first Aventura ended up lasting twice as long. Looking back on that voyage, and those on the following four Aventuras, I realise that some of the most memorable highlights of my sailing were thanks to those unforeseen detours.\n\nWhat it’s all about – incredible sailing in the world’s most spectacular locations. Photo: Oyster World Rally\n\nHaving transited the Panama Canal, rather than take the direct tradewind route to Tahiti, on the insistence of our children Doina and Ivan we turned left to visit Paddington Bear’s original home of Peru.\nFrom there we continued to Easter Island and Pitcairn, two of the most interesting islands in the world that we would have otherwise missed.\nA chance encounter with an Englishman on Easter Island led to an even longer detour and extended our South Pacific sojourn by at least one year. When I told him I was a journalist and working for the BBC, he asked whether we were planning to sail to the Ellice Islands for the forthcoming independence celebrations. He painted a very tempting picture of the planned festivities, and I was hooked on the idea.\nSo rather than continue west, as planned, towards Australia, from Fiji we turned north and witnessed the birth of Tuvalu, the smallest independent nation in the world. During the independence festivities, I met Ieremia Tabai, chief minister of the neighbouring Gilbert Islands, and future president of Kiribati, who invited us to come to their own celebrations the following year.\nBy now we were so seduced by the South Pacific and its people that we decided to spend as long as possible there instead of rushing west to complete the second half of our circumnavigation.\nFrom Tuvalu, we sailed south to New Zealand to avoid the cyclone season. The following year we returned to the tropics, and from Tonga sailed north, crossed the equator and eventually made landfall at Tarawa, the capital of Kiribati.\n\nAventura III at Romanche Glacier in Chile. Photo: Jimmy Cornell\n\nSimilarly, after the launch of Aventura III in 1998, my planned round the world voyage started with an expedition to Antarctica, accompanied by my son, Ivan But on our return we decided that rather than continue west, we’d sail north all the way to Alaska.\nThe unplanned detour started with a leisurely cruise through the spectacular Chilean fjordland, a wonderland of ever-changing scenery, with sparkling glaciers, tumbling waterfalls, and countless sheltered anchorages. On a stretch of 600 miles, there was not one single settlement, not even a house, and we met only four cruising boats and about as many fishing boats.\nFrom Chile we continued to Easter Island and Pitcairn, both of which we’d visited 22 years previously. But we took our time to call at places that we’d missed in the past: the Austral and Line Islands, as well as Hawaii and Alaska. Aventura III’s tortuous world voyage was eventually completed 12 years later.\nMy willingness to change plans and take detours is probably explained by my being open-minded whenever I am faced with an option that looks challenging but has the potential of richer rewards.\nPick crew carefully\nAfter that first voyage, whenever possible I sailed with Gwenda, or my children Doina or Ivan. When they could not join me, I had no choice but to take on crew. It was not long before I discovered that the crew problems I’d witnessed on other boats were now affecting me as well.\nOn a few occasions, I was disappointed to discover that even old friends behaved differently on the boat than ashore. Some of the worst were those who had their own boats and some offshore experience but were unable to accept my role of captain. This sad experience was obviously not unusual, and I realised that’s the reason why the majority of cruising boats are sailed by couples on their own.\n\nCornell and the first Aventura depart London in 1975. Photo: Jimmy Cornell\n\nThere must be some truth in Hemingway’s advice that “one should only sail with people you love”. The risk of having problems with occasional crew is virtually impossible to avoid because in most cases they happen after the passage has started.\nThis is one of the reasons why I always advised participants in the ARC to set an initial course to the Caribbean that passed close to the Cape Verde islands, not only because they would encounter better winds from there on but mainly because it gave them the opportunity to stop and get rid of a difficult crew. It happened every year.\nThe right attitude\nHowever, I’ve come to believe that the most important factor that can have a bearing on the success of a voyage is your attitude to the sea and sailing – and to cruising life in general.\nSetting off on a life on the ocean is a major decision that entails a complete change of both lifestyle and mentality. Leaving on a sailing yacht just because it is a convenient way to see the world is not a good enough reason. I have come across this attitude among sailors I have met, some of whom were unwilling, or more often unable, to make the transition from a shore-based mindset to becoming a full-time sailor.\n\nThe cruising Cornells – Jimmy with wife, Gwenda, and children Doina and Ivan.

Cruising the Mediterranean had been a long-held dream of ours and somehow – despite initially basing ourselves out of the UK and being full-time liveaboard cruisers for almost 10 years – we had never realised this goal. Earlier this year we turned our attention to the logistics involved in making it happen.</p>\n<p>We took delivery of our 45ft Seawind catamaran in Thailand in August 2023, and what followed was almost a year of intensive shakedowns, learning how to sail a catamaran after years on a monohull and, as hull No2 of a brand new design, identifying teething issues or design elements that could be improved.</p>\n<p>Once our shakedown cruise was complete, any warranty work carried out and our confidence improved, we contemplated our next steps. We had, as far as we could tell, three excellent options: 1, remain in Asia; 2, sail to Europe or; 3, ship to Europe.</p>\n<p>Remaining in Asia and continuing to explore one of the most underrated cruising grounds in the world was an option we seriously considered. We’d already spent much time in Thailand and knew that sailing around remote tropical archipelagos in Indonesia or exploring the crystalline waters of the Philippines would be a wonderful option.</p>\n<p>However, we had our hearts set on bringing our boat to Greece.

After all, <em>Ruby Rose 2</em> is a large, comfortable catamaran with excellent bluewater capabilities and we were keen to experience ocean sailing on her. We’ve crossed the Atlantic twice and the prospect of crossing the Indian Ocean was an exciting one, which we felt fully prepared for. If we departed Thailand in January, we’d arrive into the Mediterranean around April, which is perfect timing to enjoy the sailing season in Europe.</p>\n<p>With stopovers in the Maldives and the Middle East, the passages were not too lengthy, making the journey even more appealing. And although the 1,000-mile northbound passage along the Red Sea would be predominantly upwind, we were confident that with good timing, patience, and preparation, it would prove possible. We hoped to be part of a contingent of boats making the same journey and sailing in company.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East means that sailing the Red Sea has been discounted as an option. Getting insurance – always tricky – is now impossible, and even aside from that, the potential to be caught in a region of escalating conflict is a risk we have no interest in taking.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156560\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156560\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156560\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.prc_special_report.screenshot_2024_08_30_at_12_05_41_3-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.prc_special_report.screenshot_2024_08_30_at_12_05_41_3-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.prc_special_report.screenshot_2024_08_30_at_12_05_41_3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.prc_special_report.screenshot_2024_08_30_at_12_05_41_3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.prc_special_report.screenshot_2024_08_30_at_12_05_41_3.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156560\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nick Fabbri checks how sails fared in stowage</p></div>\n<h2>Decision time</h2>\n<p>So we examined our two remaining options: sailing around the Cape of Good Hope or shipping our boat? Sailing to Europe via the Cape of Good Hope would have taken at least 18 months due to the need to complete certain passages at very specific times of the year (it could be successfully argued that less time is required if you’re doing it true ‘delivery trip’ style, but we’re cruisers; we like to see at least a little of the cruising grounds we’re passing and we try not to set a breakneck pace if we can help it).</p>\n<p>If we’d set off from Thailand as planned in January, we would have remained in the Indian Ocean until December of that year at the earliest, in order to sail the southern coast of Africa and the Cape of Good Hope in the southern hemisphere summer, the optimal time of year.</p>\n<p>Moving west, after our <a href=\"https://yachtingworld.com/sailing-across-atlantic\">Atlantic crossing</a> and making our way to the Caribbean, we’d have been held up by hurricane season between June and November, after which our next deadline would be May or June for the east-bound Atlantic crossing to Europe.

For one, we were able to avoid the significant wear and tear that would take place if we chose the sailing option. Additionally, we would not need to fit out <em>Ruby Rose 2</em> for ocean crossings with all the spares, redundancy and additional equipment required for that specific purpose, and there would be (we hoped) no need to deal with breakages.</p>\n<p>Shipping a boat is undeniably expensive, but what often gets lost in the comparison of shipping versus sailing is that sailing a boat has cost implications too, sometimes quite significant ones, particularly when contemplating the lengthy journey I outlined above. For example, we have carbon laminate sails, which give us better performance than Dacron but are significantly less durable.</p>\n<p><em>Article continues below&#8230;</em></p>\n\n\n<div id=\"accordion\" class=\"collection-wrapper list-large \">\n\n\t\n</div><!-- /#accordion -->\n\n<p>We’ve noticed wear and tear even with the relatively light sailing we’ve done on <em>Ruby Rose 2</em> so far; there’s no doubt in my mind that sailing 20,000 miles and completing three ocean crossings would wear out our main and jib to the point where we’d need replacements not long after. The cost of that alone is a significant chunk of what our shipping costs were.</p>\n<p>Other costs involve breakages, increased insurance premiums for ocean crossings or sailing into different regions, and, as mentioned, setting the boat up for the journey with additional equipment. Once all of that is taken into account, we realised that the costs of shipping versus sailing may be closer than we’d initially assumed.</p>\n<p>So, what are the costs? I know that’s what you’re desperately wanting to know. While I can’t disclose our quote, fellow cruisers have kindly passed on information on quotes they received (to be used anonymously). These quotes are all for catamarans roughly 45ft in length, departing Asian waters this year, from a variety of shipping companies. They range from $100,000 to Sydney; $85,000 to North America (west coast); and $93,000 to Europe, which includes a 20% increase for routing around the Cape of Good Hope – a factor of the Suez situation. [Note: we contacted Sevenstar for up to date figures but they declined to give specifics].</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156557\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156557\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156557\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.prc_special_report.img_6988_3-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.prc_special_report.img_6988_3-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.prc_special_report.img_6988_3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.prc_special_report.img_6988_3.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156557\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Yachts are loaded while the ship is at anchor</p></div>\n<h2>Preparing for shipping</h2>\n<p>We had six weeks to cover the 1,300 miles to Phuket from Pattaya (only 300 miles apart as the crow flies but you have to go via the Singapore Strait), and we arrived into Phuket with two weeks to prepare the boat for shipping.</p>\n<p>The preparation was akin to getting ready to ride out a storm, combined with leaving the boat for a couple of months. Our main objective was to ensure everything was stowed away and secured, plus the boat had to be completely shut down. Some tasks could be done well in advance; others could only be done as the boat was tied up to the ship.</p>\n<p>Some examples include removing the headsails (it was advised to remove the main sail also, but we didn’t do this); ensure the dinghy was secure with drain plug removed; stow all loose items inside, and remove all loose items from the outside such as cushions and floor matting.</p>\n<p>We were advised to attach a feeder line to all halyards, run it up the mast, then put the ends of the halyard in a sailbag, thus ensuring that no part of the halyard is exposed to the elements. We didn’t do this, but I would advise it; absolutely everything exposed will get caked in seawater and dirt, and this step will save you from cleaning your halyards along with everything else.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156558\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156558\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156558\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.prc_special_report.img_7003_3-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.prc_special_report.img_7003_3-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.prc_special_report.img_7003_3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.prc_special_report.img_7003_3.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156558\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Divers ensure the correct placement of lifting straps</p></div>\n<p>Another good precaution against damage from saltwater and dirt is to use Vaseline or wax on exterior stainless steel, cover and shrink wrap furling foils and winches, and there are also coatings for painted surfaces to protect them from seawater spray.</p>\n<p>The other aspect of our preparation involved readying the boat to be left unattended for about six weeks and included all the usual items such as pickling the watermaker, emptying tanks as much as possible (although we accidentally left the rain catchment valve open, and when our boat arrived in Türkiye our water tanks were full of fresh Indian Ocean rainwater!), and sanitise the heads and fresh water system.</p>\n<h2>Loading onto the ship</h2>\n<p>In the weeks leading up to departure, our agent emailed us regularly with updates on the ship’s movements. We had about a two-week delay from our original estimated date due to weather, but once the ship had arrived in Phuket we were given a schedule with our estimated load date and time. This was subject to last minute changes due to unforeseen delays in the schedule and we were instructed not to book flights until our boat was loaded onto the ship.</p>\n<p>On the morning of our loading we left the marina and motored the four miles to where the cargo ship was anchored, ready to approach when the time was right. Our agent, Chris, was in a RIB, and when the cargo ship was ready for us, he relayed that information to us via VHF. The tie up position was indicated by large orange fenders, and on approach the ship’s crew threw us down a bow and stern line.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_156554\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-156554\" class=\"size-large wp-image-156554\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.prc_special_report.dji_0210_mp4_00_00_34_02_still003-630x354.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.prc_special_report.dji_0210_mp4_00_00_34_02_still003-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.prc_special_report.dji_0210_mp4_00_00_34_02_still003-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.prc_special_report.dji_0210_mp4_00_00_34_02_still003-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.prc_special_report.dji_0210_mp4_00_00_34_02_still003.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-156554\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Boat transport firms will fill their vessels to spread the cost of shipping</p></div>\n<p>Once the boat was secure, the ship’s crew took over with the handling of our boat. They jumped down onto our deck and ensured they were happy with the lines and fenders. Two divers went over the side to position the lifting straps. As this work was being done we shut the boat down, turning everything off including our batteries. We did a last sweep making sure everything was properly stowed and all the hatches and doors were shut and locked, then grabbed our bag, locked the boat up, handed a spare key to the foreman and climbed into Chris’s waiting RIB.</p>\n<p>Watching <em>Ruby Rose 2</em> get craned onto the cargo ship was quite an experience.

This took a good few days, and included washing all the clutches, lines, winches, blocks and shackles. We rigged the jib and screecher and gave the jib furler a good scrub.</p>\n<p>We were fully aware that the process of shipping can cause damage to boats, particularly when craning vessels on and off the ship. However, we’d never heard of rust damage before, but that’s what we experienced.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Considering shipping a yacht? Terysa Vanderloo shares her experiences of shipping her catamaran from Thailand to Türkiye, plus what owners really need to know about shipping their own boat.\n\nWhen my partner Nick and I had our dream boat built in Asia, we knew that one day we’d face the dilemma of somehow transporting her to Europe. Cruising the Mediterranean had been a long-held dream of ours and somehow – despite initially basing ourselves out of the UK and being full-time liveaboard cruisers for almost 10 years – we had never realised this goal. Earlier this year we turned our attention to the logistics involved in making it happen.\nWe took delivery of our 45ft Seawind catamaran in Thailand in August 2023, and what followed was almost a year of intensive shakedowns, learning how to sail a catamaran after years on a monohull and, as hull No2 of a brand new design, identifying teething issues or design elements that could be improved.\nOnce our shakedown cruise was complete, any warranty work carried out and our confidence improved, we contemplated our next steps. We had, as far as we could tell, three excellent options: 1, remain in Asia; 2, sail to Europe or; 3, ship to Europe.\nRemaining in Asia and continuing to explore one of the most underrated cruising grounds in the world was an option we seriously considered. We’d already spent much time in Thailand and knew that sailing around remote tropical archipelagos in Indonesia or exploring the crystalline waters of the Philippines would be a wonderful option.\nHowever, we had our hearts set on bringing our boat to Greece. Before we became full-time liveaboards, we used to holiday in Greece every year and watching the many yachts coming and going truly did keep us motivated and focused on our goal of moving onto our own boat.\nAfter almost a decade sailing far-flung locations we also wanted to be close to family in the UK. We just felt in our hearts that the Mediterranean was where we wanted to be after all this time away. So, decision made, we turned our attention on how to get our boat there.\n\nUnforseen and unavoidable delays in shipping schedules mean it’s advisable not to book onward travel until your boat is actually loaded onto the ship\n\nSailing versus Shipping\nOriginally we’d planned to sail. After all, Ruby Rose 2 is a large, comfortable catamaran with excellent bluewater capabilities and we were keen to experience ocean sailing on her. We’ve crossed the Atlantic twice and the prospect of crossing the Indian Ocean was an exciting one, which we felt fully prepared for. If we departed Thailand in January, we’d arrive into the Mediterranean around April, which is perfect timing to enjoy the sailing season in Europe.\nWith stopovers in the Maldives and the Middle East, the passages were not too lengthy, making the journey even more appealing. And although the 1,000-mile northbound passage along the Red Sea would be predominantly upwind, we were confident that with good timing, patience, and preparation, it would prove possible. We hoped to be part of a contingent of boats making the same journey and sailing in company.\nUnfortunately the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East means that sailing the Red Sea has been discounted as an option. Getting insurance – always tricky – is now impossible, and even aside from that, the potential to be caught in a region of escalating conflict is a risk we have no interest in taking.\n\nNick Fabbri checks how sails fared in stowage\n\nDecision time\nSo we examined our two remaining options: sailing around the Cape of Good Hope or shipping our boat? Sailing to Europe via the Cape of Good Hope would have taken at least 18 months due to the need to complete certain passages at very specific times of the year (it could be successfully argued that less time is required if you’re doing it true ‘delivery trip’ style, but we’re cruisers; we like to see at least a little of the cruising grounds we’re passing and we try not to set a breakneck pace if we can help it).\nIf we’d set off from Thailand as planned in January, we would have remained in the Indian Ocean until December of that year at the earliest, in order to sail the southern coast of Africa and the Cape of Good Hope in the southern hemisphere summer, the optimal time of year.\nMoving west, after our Atlantic crossing and making our way to the Caribbean, we’d have been held up by hurricane season between June and November, after which our next deadline would be May or June for the east-bound Atlantic crossing to Europe. That’s three ocean crossings and about 20,000 miles – an exciting adventure that we seriously contemplated.\n\nRuby Rose 2’s foresail goes back up\n\nThe other option, less adventurous but far more expedient, was to ship our boat to Europe.\nWe reached out to the main shipping companies and after considering all our options, we decided to go ahead with shipping our catamaran with Sevenstar.\nCosting it out\nWe decided that shipping had several major advantages over sailing, not just in terms of expediency. For one, we were able to avoid the significant wear and tear that would take place if we chose the sailing option. Additionally, we would not need to fit out Ruby Rose 2 for ocean crossings with all the spares, redundancy and additional equipment required for that specific purpose, and there would be (we hoped) no need to deal with breakages.\nShipping a boat is undeniably expensive, but what often gets lost in the comparison of shipping versus sailing is that sailing a boat has cost implications too, sometimes quite significant ones, particularly when contemplating the lengthy journey I outlined above. For example, we have carbon laminate sails, which give us better performance than Dacron but are significantly less durable.\nArticle continues below…\n\n\nWe’ve noticed wear and tear even with the relatively light sailing we’ve done on Ruby Rose 2 so far; there’s no doubt in my mind that sailing 20,000 miles and completing three ocean crossings would wear out our main and jib to the point where we’d need replacements not long after. The cost of that alone is a significant chunk of what our shipping costs were.\nOther costs involve breakages, increased insurance premiums for ocean crossings or sailing into different regions, and, as mentioned, setting the boat up for the journey with additional equipment. Once all of that is taken into account, we realised that the costs of shipping versus sailing may be closer than we’d initially assumed.\nSo, what are the costs? I know that’s what you’re desperately wanting to know. While I can’t disclose our quote, fellow cruisers have kindly passed on information on quotes they received (to be used anonymously). These quotes are all for catamarans roughly 45ft in length, departing Asian waters this year, from a variety of shipping companies. They range from $100,000 to Sydney; $85,000 to North America (west coast); and $93,000 to Europe, which includes a 20% increase for routing around the Cape of Good Hope – a factor of the Suez situation. [Note: we contacted Sevenstar for up to date figures but they declined to give specifics].\n\nYachts are loaded while the ship is at anchor\n\nPreparing for shipping\nWe had six weeks to cover the 1,300 miles to Phuket from Pattaya (only 300 miles apart as the crow flies but you have to go via the Singapore Strait), and we arrived into Phuket with two weeks to prepare the boat for shipping.\nThe preparation was akin to getting ready to ride out a storm, combined with leaving the boat for a couple of months. Our main objective was to ensure everything was stowed away and secured, plus the boat had to be completely shut down. Some tasks could be done well in advance; others could only be done as the boat was tied up to the ship.\nSome examples include removing the headsails (it was advised to remove the main sail also, but we didn’t do this); ensure the dinghy was secure with drain plug removed; stow all loose items inside, and remove all loose items from the outside such as cushions and floor matting.\nWe were advised to attach a feeder line to all halyards, run it up the mast, then put the ends of the halyard in a sailbag, thus ensuring that no part of the halyard is exposed to the elements. We didn’t do this, but I would advise it; absolutely everything exposed will get caked in seawater and dirt, and this step will save you from cleaning your halyards along with everything else.\n\nDivers ensure the correct placement of lifting straps\n\nAnother good precaution against damage from saltwater and dirt is to use Vaseline or wax on exterior stainless steel, cover and shrink wrap furling foils and winches, and there are also coatings for painted surfaces to protect them from seawater spray.\nThe other aspect of our preparation involved readying the boat to be left unattended for about six weeks and included all the usual items such as pickling the watermaker, emptying tanks as much as possible (although we accidentally left the rain catchment valve open, and when our boat arrived in Türkiye our water tanks were full of fresh Indian Ocean rainwater!), and sanitise the heads and fresh water system.\nLoading onto the ship\nIn the weeks leading up to departure, our agent emailed us regularly with updates on the ship’s movements. We had about a two-week delay from our original estimated date due to weather, but once the ship had arrived in Phuket we were given a schedule with our estimated load date and time. This was subject to last minute changes due to unforeseen delays in the schedule and we were instructed not to book flights until our boat was loaded onto the ship.\nOn the morning of our loading we left the marina and motored the four miles to where the cargo ship was anchored, ready to approach when the time was right. Our agent, Chris, was in a RIB, and when the cargo ship was ready for us, he relayed that information to us via VHF. The tie up position was indicated by large orange fenders, and on approach the ship’s crew threw us down a bow and stern line.\n\nBoat transport firms will fill their vessels to spread the cost of shipping\n\nOnce the boat was secure, the ship’s crew took over with the handling of our boat. They jumped down onto our deck and ensured they were happy with the lines and fenders. Two divers went over the side to position the lifting straps. As this work was being done we shut the boat down, turning everything off including our batteries. We did a last sweep making sure everything was properly stowed and all the hatches and doors were shut and locked, then grabbed our bag, locked the boat up, handed a spare key to the foreman and climbed into Chris’s waiting RIB.\nWatching Ruby Rose 2 get craned onto the cargo ship was quite an experience. She was slowly raised and then guided into position using long lines before being lowered onto the deck and secured in cradles.\nUnloading in Marmaris\nFive weeks later in Marmaris, Türkiye, we watched from the deck of the cargo ship as Ruby Rose 2 was lowered back into the water, then climbed down a ladder to board our catamaran. We motored into Marmaris Bay and anchored, ready to get on with the mammoth task of cleaning every exposed inch as she was absolutely caked in salt and dirt. This took a good few days, and included washing all the clutches, lines, winches, blocks and shackles. We rigged the jib and screecher and gave the jib furler a good scrub.\nWe were fully aware that the process of shipping can cause damage to boats, particularly when craning vessels on and off the ship. However, we’d never heard of rust damage before, but that’s what we experienced. What we originally took for caked-on Saharan dirt turned out to be a significant amount of rust stains which needed to be chemically removed.\n\nTerysa Vanderloo and her partner, Nick Fabbri, live aboard their Seawind 1370 Ruby Rose 2 and document their adventures on YouTube and at sailingrubyrose.com\n\nThe rust was on almost every exposed surface, in particular the underside of the hull and the back of the boat, including the transom, dinghy and davits, and the targa arch. We contacted Sevenstar and were reassured when they sent out a surveyor immediately to assess the extent of the damage.\nWe are now in the process of resolving the rust damage with the shipping company; a preliminary clean has taken place and when Ruby Rose 2 is hauled out for winter that work will continue.\nThe verdict\nWe spent much of the time between signing our shipping contract and taking delivery in Marmaris second guessing our decision. The upfront cost was significant, and an additional 20% was belatedly added for taking the longer route around the Cape of Good Hope. Was it really worth it?\nHowever, as soon as we left Marmaris and sailed for the very first time along the beautiful Turkish coastline, the waters beneath our hull a clear cobalt blue, we knew we’d made the right decision. The Greek island of Rhodes – the location of so many summer holidays – was visible in the distance and the prospect of sailing into Mandraki harbour where we’d spent years dreaming about living on a boat was incredibly exciting. We haven’t once regretted our decision and are loving cruising in the Mediterranean.\nIf you enjoyed this….\nYachting World is the world’s leading magazine for bluewater cruisers and offshore sailors.

Photo: Alison Langley\nThis more classic and cruising-oriented design is intended as a blend of timeless design and contemporary innovation, with a gracefully balanced hull reminiscent of those of the mid-20th century.\nBy contrast, the deck layout borrows heavily on today’s thinking. The forward part of the cockpit is an upholstered area for lounging and entertaining, while sail controls are led aft to the area around the central single wheel, allowing the boat to be conned from here when being sailed single-handed.\n\nThe Stephen Waring 39 is a classic and cruising-oriented design. Photo: Alison Langley\n\nAs far as possible the boat is set up for push-button sailing, with electric winches to handle sheets for jibs and reaching sails, as well as hoisting the in-boom furling mainsail. The mainsheet is controlled using an innovative hydraulic under-deck system.\nWisp will be based in Long Island Sound and has moderate draught, but in other respects her performance was maximised. The sail plan includes a working jib and a large, multi-purpose reacher, each on fixed furlers, ensuring adaptability and ease of handling. A swing-out anchor launch system helps preserve the yacht’s aesthetics, without compromising practicality.\nWisp is the latest design from Stephens Waring, a custom naval architecture and engineering firm that’s now regarded as being one of the best in the spirit of tradition world.\n“Collaborating closely with our clients, Wisp transforms their dreams into reality,” says co-designer Paul Waring, “offering a powerful, elegant, and versatile sailing experience with uncompromising construction quality.”\n\nThe Stephen Waring 39 includes a foam-cored plywood deck, which increases structural stiffness.

Nevertheless, he managed to hold on to an impressive top five position as the fleet rounded the Cape of Good Hope, despite losing an autopilot at an early stage.</p>\n<figure class=\"o-container youtube\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Vendée Globe 2024 Sam Goodchild exclusive | &#039;I can&#039;t cover 40 boats&#039; | Yachting World\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/DmhANX6Z6ss?feature=oembed&#038;fs=0&#038;modestbranding=1&#038;theme=light&#038;showinfo=1&#038;autohide=0&#038;rel=0?list=PL9Ch3lKZPY6IuK-tzuE0HqYKQpncbjymo\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>\n<p>Once the fleet entered the Southern Ocean his previous generation boat – which team mate Thomas Ruyant had sailed in the 2000 Vendée Globe as <em>LinkedOut</em> – was outpaced by some of the newer foiling designs, but he rounded Cape Horn in a top 10 position.</p>\n<p>He chipped his way back through the fleet on the return South Atlantic leg, maintaining a high work rate and taking some smart inshore routes.</p>\n<p>By the time he passed Fernando de Noronha, he was locked in a duel with Beyou off the coast of Brazil duel &#8211; at its most intense the pair were just 3 miles apart as they passed the latitude of the Canary Islands, while a major front brought 7m-plus waves and 50-knot winds that the leaders had to pass through in the final week.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A squall came through, I was sailing with 2 reefs and a J3, and in a big wave the stern got picked up and thrown to one side into a gybe. The pilot did its best to catch it, but unfortunately wasn&#8217;t quick enough. Because I was dead downwind the main did a quick gybe &#8211; broke all he battens around the backstay &#8211; and then when it gybed back again it just split it two.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Goodchild diverted east, sailing goose winged under twin headsails, and began a mammoth 48-hour repair, using over a dozen tubes of glue and sikaflex to patch the split sail together with a rigid panel in the luff. Despite having to contend with waves washing down the deck while trying to glue the panels, he was able to rehoist his sail and continue sailing to finish within the top 10.</p>\n<figure class=\"o-container youtube\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Vendée Globe: Sam Goodchild on the incredible repair he made after a 54-knot storm shredded his main\" width=\"630\" height=\"354\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/DjoQ785Yag8?feature=oembed&#038;fs=0&#038;modestbranding=1&#038;theme=light&#038;showinfo=1&#038;autohide=0&#038;rel=0?start=115&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>\n<h2>Sam Goodchild&#8217;s Vendée Globe</h2>\n<p>Speaking after today&#8217;s finish he said: &#8220;Today again, I knew that even if [the sail] broke again, I could finish. So, I gave it everything I had, and it held up.</p>\n<p>“It’s true that [the damage] happened when I was competing for the Top 5, but in hindsight, I’m satisfied.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My goal of doing this Vendée Globe has very much been achieved.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Sam Goodchild is the first British skipper home in the Vendée Globe, finishing an impressive 9th in his first attempt at the solo round the world race\nLES SABLES D'OLONNE, FRANCE - JANUARY 25, 2025 : VULNERABLE skipper Sam Goodchild (GBR) is celebrating with flares after taking 9th place in the Vendee Globe, on January 25, 2025 in Les Sables d'Olonne, France - (Photo by Anne Beauge / Alea)\nBritish solo skipper Sam Goodchild today finished the Vendée Globe in an impressive 9th place, and first Brit home in the solo around the world race.\nIt was a hugely respectable performance for the ‘rookie’ skipper, who only joined the IMOCA class two years ago, with Goodchild and his previous generation IMOCA Vulnerable duelling with experienced French contender Jérémie Beyou on Charal for 4th place until the very last days of the race.\n\nSam Goodchild (GBR) finishes in 9th place in the Vendee Globe, on January 25, 2025 in Les Sables d’Olonne, France. Photo: Jean-Marie Liot / Alea\n\nSadly for Sam and British fans, the mainsail on Vulnerable split in a 54-knot storm just days from the finish, which ended his battle with Beyou and allowed four more boats to overtake while he made substantial repairs.\nHe finished after 76 days, 02 hours, 01 minutes and 45 seconds of racing, which put him 11 days, six hours and 38 minutes behind race winner Charlie Dalin of France.\nImpressive rookie performance\nGoodchild’s first Vendée Globe got off to an incredible start, leading for much of the early stages in the North Atlantic despite being on a boat which was four years older than most of the front-runners.\nEver sanguine, he told Yachting World in the first of a series of exclusive weekly video blogs, that he knew he ‘wasn’t going to lead all they way’. Nevertheless, he managed to hold on to an impressive top five position as the fleet rounded the Cape of Good Hope, despite losing an autopilot at an early stage.\n\nOnce the fleet entered the Southern Ocean his previous generation boat – which team mate Thomas Ruyant had sailed in the 2000 Vendée Globe as LinkedOut – was outpaced by some of the newer foiling designs, but he rounded Cape Horn in a top 10 position.\nHe chipped his way back through the fleet on the return South Atlantic leg, maintaining a high work rate and taking some smart inshore routes.\nBy the time he passed Fernando de Noronha, he was locked in a duel with Beyou off the coast of Brazil duel – at its most intense the pair were just 3 miles apart as they passed the latitude of the Canary Islands, while a major front brought 7m-plus waves and 50-knot winds that the leaders had to pass through in the final week.\n“A squall came through, I was sailing with 2 reefs and a J3, and in a big wave the stern got picked up and thrown to one side into a gybe. The pilot did its best to catch it, but unfortunately wasn’t quick enough. Because I was dead downwind the main did a quick gybe – broke all he battens around the backstay – and then when it gybed back again it just split it two.”\nGoodchild diverted east, sailing goose winged under twin headsails, and began a mammoth 48-hour repair, using over a dozen tubes of glue and sikaflex to patch the split sail together with a rigid panel in the luff. Despite having to contend with waves washing down the deck while trying to glue the panels, he was able to rehoist his sail and continue sailing to finish within the top 10.\n\nSam Goodchild’s Vendée Globe\nSpeaking after today’s finish he said: “Today again, I knew that even if [the sail] broke again, I could finish. So, I gave it everything I had, and it held up.\n“It’s true that [the damage] happened when I was competing for the Top 5, but in hindsight, I’m satisfied.\n“My goal of doing this Vendée Globe has very much been achieved. I’ve been dreaming of this race for 20 years, it’s shaped my life. It’s why I live in France, why I have a French family… Everything revolves around the Vendée Globe, it’s the common thread of my journey.\n“So losing a place isn’t so bad compared to what this adventure represents for me.”\nSeveral times throughout the race he commented on how he was pleasantly surprised by how much he was enjoying the race – his longest period of sailing solo by many multiples.\n“Of course, there were difficult moments, but ‘cracking up’ is not my style. And I just would not complain.\n\nSam Goodchild’s Vulnerable given a fantastic reception in Les Sable d’Olonne after finishing 9th.

With so many human, technical and environmental factors feeding into overall performance on the race course, Dolan is always looking at ways of simplifying any process that he can.</p>\n<p>One key area is understanding the complex tidal stream scenarios faced on every leg of the Solitaire du Figaro. With the scoreboard based on aggregate time, every moment matters. Dolan applies a few key rules of thumb to help analyse strategic and tactical situations – even in brutal sailing conditions where he is likely short on sleep and looking to manage his energy levels as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>In this extended ‘5 Tips’, Tom shares his expert advice on how to think clearly in complex scenarios, and be the most efficient tadpole in the tide possible.</p>\n<h2>Set priorities</h2>\n<p>When you’re sailing <a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/tag/shorthanded-sailing\">short-handed</a> and short on sleep, you need to keep things as simple as possible. I have a pile of strategic priorities I keep uppermost in my mind. I list them here in no particular order, as it’s always moving according to changing circumstances.</p>\n<p>If conditions change, the order changes. When we pass a mark, again the order may very well change. If we find ourselves defending a lead, the order might change again. They are: synoptic wind; local effects; sea breeze; tidal current or shift; your opponents; and race course geometry.</p>\n<p><em>Article continues below&#8230;</em></p>\n\n\n<div id=\"accordion\" class=\"collection-wrapper list-large \">\n\n\t\t\t\t<article class=\"loop loop-list-large row post-156098 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-sail-faster-sail-safer tag-5-tips tag-top-stories publication_name-yachting-world loop-odd loop-19 featured-image\" role=\"article\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 entry-media\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/sail-faster-sail-safer/5-expert-tips-for-sailing-in-cold-weather-156098\" rel=\"bookmark\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/12/YAW304.prc_5tips.241204_16ds_cr_r10_uni_mer_01660.jpg\" class=\" wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/12/YAW304.prc_5tips.241204_16ds_cr_r10_uni_mer_01660.jpg 2000w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/12/YAW304.prc_5tips.241204_16ds_cr_r10_uni_mer_01660-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/12/YAW304.prc_5tips.241204_16ds_cr_r10_uni_mer_01660-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/12/YAW304.prc_5tips.241204_16ds_cr_r10_uni_mer_01660-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" data-image-id=\"156099\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/sail-faster-sail-safer/5-expert-tips-for-sailing-in-cold-weather-156098\" rel=\"bookmark\">5 expert tips for sailing in cold weather</a></h2>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</header>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\n                            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Unlike most of us, Bob Beggs seeks out extreme cold and is currently planning his next yachting venture into the&hellip;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</article>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<article class=\"loop loop-list-large row post-150527 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-5-tips tag-expert-tips tag-how-to tag-top-stories publication_name-yachting-world loop-odd loop-19 featured-image\" role=\"article\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 entry-media\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/5-tips/5-expert-tips-shorthanded-mainsail-reefing-150527\" rel=\"bookmark\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/02/YAW294.prc_5tips.fn23st_8411-scaled.jpg\" class=\" wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/02/YAW294.prc_5tips.fn23st_8411-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/02/YAW294.prc_5tips.fn23st_8411-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/02/YAW294.prc_5tips.fn23st_8411-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/02/YAW294.prc_5tips.fn23st_8411-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/02/YAW294.prc_5tips.fn23st_8411-2048x1152.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" data-image-id=\"150529\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/5-tips/5-expert-tips-shorthanded-mainsail-reefing-150527\" rel=\"bookmark\">5 expert tips: Shorthanded mainsail reefing</a></h2>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</header>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\n                            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The double-handed team of Deb Fish and Rob Craigie have got mainsail reefing down to a fine art. “Even when&hellip;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</article>\n\n\t\t\t\n</div><!-- /#accordion -->\n\n<h2>Adjust for point of sail</h2>\n<p>The position of tide in the pyramid of priorities depends on a number of factors including the strength of the tide, the strength of the wind and your point of sail. For example, the lighter the wind the more important the tide becomes, so the higher it moves up the list.</p>\n<p>The point of sail is also vital. When sailing upwind against the tide, the wind and the tide are in the same direction, so this decreases the apparent wind flowing over your sails. Not only are you sailing against the tide – which slows your ground speed – but you’re also sailing in less wind which reduces your surface speed. So generally speaking, when sailing upwind, the tide gets bumped right up to the top of the pile.</p>\n<p>Sailing downwind is a little different, as wind and tide are opposed, and the apparent wind flowing over the sails increases. The Figaro 3 is a light boat and the polars take quite a steep jump when sailing downwind.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "The Solitaire du Figaro is one of the most notoriously tidal racecourses in sailing; 2024 winner Tom Dolan explains tidal planning strategy with Andy Rice\n\n“We’re all tadpoles swimming in a stream,” says Tom Dolan of single-handed offshore racing. With so many human, technical and environmental factors feeding into overall performance on the race course, Dolan is always looking at ways of simplifying any process that he can.\nOne key area is understanding the complex tidal stream scenarios faced on every leg of the Solitaire du Figaro. With the scoreboard based on aggregate time, every moment matters. Dolan applies a few key rules of thumb to help analyse strategic and tactical situations – even in brutal sailing conditions where he is likely short on sleep and looking to manage his energy levels as efficiently as possible.\nIn this extended ‘5 Tips’, Tom shares his expert advice on how to think clearly in complex scenarios, and be the most efficient tadpole in the tide possible.\nSet priorities\nWhen you’re sailing short-handed and short on sleep, you need to keep things as simple as possible. I have a pile of strategic priorities I keep uppermost in my mind. I list them here in no particular order, as it’s always moving according to changing circumstances.\nIf conditions change, the order changes. When we pass a mark, again the order may very well change. If we find ourselves defending a lead, the order might change again. They are: synoptic wind; local effects; sea breeze; tidal current or shift; your opponents; and race course geometry.\nArticle continues below…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n5 expert tips for sailing in cold weather\nUnlike most of us, Bob Beggs seeks out extreme cold and is currently planning his next yachting venture into the…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n5 expert tips: Shorthanded mainsail reefing\nThe double-handed team of Deb Fish and Rob Craigie have got mainsail reefing down to a fine art. “Even when…\n\n\nAdjust for point of sail\nThe position of tide in the pyramid of priorities depends on a number of factors including the strength of the tide, the strength of the wind and your point of sail. For example, the lighter the wind the more important the tide becomes, so the higher it moves up the list.\nThe point of sail is also vital. When sailing upwind against the tide, the wind and the tide are in the same direction, so this decreases the apparent wind flowing over your sails. Not only are you sailing against the tide – which slows your ground speed – but you’re also sailing in less wind which reduces your surface speed. So generally speaking, when sailing upwind, the tide gets bumped right up to the top of the pile.\nSailing downwind is a little different, as wind and tide are opposed, and the apparent wind flowing over the sails increases. The Figaro 3 is a light boat and the polars take quite a steep jump when sailing downwind. So an increase or decrease in wind speed or a shift in wind direction can relegate the tide to second or third place on our pyramid.\nIn both cases, wind and tide are together or opposed, so the zones of stronger or weaker flow are quite easily seen over the water in many cases, and can also be marked by long banks of seaweed. Just like looking at clouds in the sky to tell us what’s going on with the wind, seaweed and waves can act a bit like clouds in the water.\nAnother important thing to watch is the topography.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "In a shock statement, INEOS has announced that the Britannia team has split from team boss Sir Ben Ainslie, and intend to launch its own challenge, throwing the British America's Cup bid for the 38th America's Cup into question. Sir Ben Ainslie says he is 'astounded' by the announcement\nSome choice words were picked up on Ainslie's hot mic. Photo: America's Cup\nIn a surprise announcement, INEOS – who backed Sir Ben Ainslie’s America’s Cup Challenges for the 36th and 37th America’s Cup – has reported that it has split from Ainslie and intend to launch a separate challenge.\nThe statement released this afternoon reads:\n‘INEOS will enter a challenge for the 38th America’s Cup under the team name INEOS Britannia after parting ways with Sir Ben Ainslie.\n‘Unfortunately, INEOS Britannia and Sir Ben could not find agreement on terms to move forward following the conclusion of the 37th America’s Cup in Barcelona.\n‘INEOS Britannia has appointed Dave Endean as CEO, who brings immense experience in sailing and the America’s Cup. INEOS will also continue to leverage the design and technology expertise of the Mercedes F1 Team under the guidance of Technical Director, James Allison.\n‘Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Chairman of INEOS said: “I am enormously proud of what we achieved in Barcelona in developing a British boat that was truly competitive for the first time in decades. It set new benchmarks for British sailing, including winning the Louis Vuitton Cup for the first time, and taking races off the Defender in the finals for the first time in 90 years.\n“We will now build upon this for the 38th America’s Cup through the INEOS challenge and already have 100 scientists and engineers working on the design of our AC38 yacht.”\n‘More details on the INEOS Britannia challenge will follow in due course.’\nAinslie ‘astounded’\nSeveral hours after the INEOS announcement, Ainslie’s team issued their own update. It read:\n‘The British Challenger for the 38th America’s Cup, led by Sir Ben Ainslie, was astounded to read today’s statement from INEOS and Mercedes F1 regarding their planned challenge for the 38th America’s Cup. This plan raises significant legal and practical obstacles for them that will play out in the coming days and weeks.\n‘Furthermore, Sir Ben Ainslie’s British America’s Cup team will be known as Athena Racing going forwards, aligning with the British Women’s and Youth America’s Cup team, the Athena Pathway.’\n\nBen Ainslie (right) co-helmed the INEOS Britannia AC75 with Dylan Fletcher (left) in the 37th America’s Cup. Photo: Ian Roman / America’s Cup\n\nINEOS ends Ainslie partnership\nThe announcement comes three months after INEOS Britannia were defeated in the 37th America’s Cup by Defenders Emirates Team New Zealand – the first time a British team had reached a Cup Match final since 1964.\nIt was confirmed at the time that the British would again be Challenger of Record, representing the Royal Yacht Squadron, for the 38th America’s Cup.\nThe RYS told Yachting World that this latest development is ‘purely a commercial matter between INEOS and Athena [Ben Ainslie]’.\nRYS Limited is Challenger of Record for the 38th America’s Cup, and it’s not yet known whether INEOS Britannia may represent the RYS or challenge representing another yacht club.\nThere have been rumours that Ainslie’s relationship with INEOS founder and CEO Sir Jim Ratcliffe was foundering. At the press ‘mixed zone’ after the final race of the 37th America’s Cup Ainslie was noted to not be wearing INEOS branding.\n\nGrant Dalton congratulates INEOS Britannia backer Sir Jim Ratcliffe on winning the Louis Vuitton Cup Final in the 37th America’s Cup. Photo: Ian Roman / America’s Cup\n\nRatcliffe is renowned for his substantial investment in sports, including sponsorship of the INEOS Grenadiers cycling team (though the team has announced that they are looking for additional backers for the coming season), and notably ownership of Manchester United football team, as well as Lausanne-Sport and Nice football teams, and as principal partner of Mercedes AMG-F1.\nThe collaboration between Mercedes F1 team and INEOS Britannia America’s Cup team was widely credited as helping get the British team to the America’s Cup final, although it was also known to be a challenging relationship.\nRatcliffe is known to be undertaking cost-cutting exercises across many of his sporting investments. Ainslie confirmed after the 37th America’s Cup that they were seeking additional backers for the next challenge, telling Yachting World in Barcelona in October: “Jim’s definitely behind the team. Quite what that looks like, I think we’ve got to figure out.\n“It would be good if we could bring in some other partners. Because really, he and his mates at INEOS have been phenomenal to back two campaigns on their own. Now it’s really time to bring in some other support.”\nA British Cup without Ben?\nThis latest news creates a remarkable scenario: the possibility of a British team with a title sponsor not headed up (either on the water or off) by Sir Ben Ainslie (or even possibly competing against him).\nNot only the most successful Olympic sailor of all time, Ainslie has been intrinsically connected to the America’s Cup for over two decades.\nThe 37th America’s Cup was his third successive Challenge as skipper of a British team – two backed by INEOS, the first in partnership with Land Rover.\nPrior to that he won the 34th America’s Cup as tactician for Oracle Team USA, helmed by Jimmy Spithill, in one of the most remarkable sporting comebacks of all time.\n\nAinslie winning the America’s Cup with Oracle Team USA in 2013.

Photo: Fabio Taccola\nRoberto and Luisa Lacorte are passionate sailors with enviable track records of yacht ownership, including Flying Nikka, the Mark Mills-designed Mini Maxi that uses similar foiling technology to the America’s Cup (see video and more on that at yachtingworld.com).\nWhen it came to choosing a yacht to sail as a couple, or with family and friends, they turned to Giovanni Ceccarelli who created the standout Ceccarelli 42 spirit of tradition yacht. Slender hull lines with low freeboard and a beam of only 3.16m (10ft 4in), plus extensive external woodwork echo a style of earlier times, as do the deep bulwarks and long aft deck.\n\nThe Ceccarelli 42. Photo: Fabio Taccola\n\nYet the Ceccarelli 42 is absolutely a contemporary yacht, with a near plumb bow and stern, a powerful square-top mainsail and long bowsprit for reaching sails and asymmetric spinnakers. Below the waterline is a high-aspect deep draught torpedo bulb keel and efficient single rudder, while a displacement of only 6,400kg puts the boat firmly in the high-performance category.\nTiller steering suits a boat of this style perfectly and helps make for easier solo and short-handed manoeuvring. It also maximises cockpit space that can be freed up for après sail socialising. Despite LuluNikka’s sleek lines there’s also welcoming accommodation for weekending in an interior that shows off her construction.\n\nLuluNikka’s spirit of tradition design shows in her pleasing hull lines and an interior that highlights her timber construction at its best. Photo: Fabio Taccola\n\nLuluNikka was built at the Checchi Shipyard in north-western Italy, and is expected to be a regular at regattas and rallies on the Mediterranean classic circuit.\nArticle continues below…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nAmerica’s Cup boats: 8 facts about the AC75 and why they’re unique\nThe AC75 is the class of boat that takes part in the America’s Cup and are arguably the most radical…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWorld’s coolest yachts: Superyacht Heitaros\nI first saw Heitaros sailing in St Barth and thought it was a beautiful 60- or 80-footer but, as we…\n\n\nCeccarelli 42 Specifications:\nLOA: 14.5m 47ft 6in\nceccarelliyachtdesign.com\n\nPhoto: Fabio Taccola\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this….\nYachting World is the world’s leading magazine for bluewater cruisers and offshore sailors.

From working for owners and using their credit cards to pay the bills, I know full well that the saying ‘owning a boat is like standing in a shower and ripping up bank notes’ rings true.</p>\n<p>I’ve now learned that process begins right at the purchase stage, because apparently it’s a rite of passage to buy a boat that’s triple your original budget&#8230;</p>\n<p>Like any sensible sailor, I called upon the advice of trusted friends, colleagues and clients. Should I buy the boat? Am I crazy?</p>\n<p>Naturally, I picked my advisers carefully: all people who would say ‘YES!’ Romantics, who don’t care for details. Remortgage my house? Sure! Spend a significant proportion of my income on berthing fees? Dreams are priceless!</p>\n<p>Boat infatuation is intoxicating. I’m coming to realise that buying a boat is like embarking on a new relationship. The first stage is the dreamy honeymoon phase. Your love can do no wrong! Even their flaws are endearing. Looking up at the deckhead, I saw some water damage. “Hmm, it looks like the deck is leaking. I’d probably enjoy replacing the teak.” Right&#8230;</p>\n<p>What happens next? The sugar coating will wear thin. Flaws become irritating, infuriating. Lesson 1: just like people we can’t expect boats to change.

Realising that her slow acceleration upwind wasn’t just a bad day; it’s who she fundamentally is. Understanding that she will never be as tidy as you want her to be. And, disappointingly, she will always – always – groan and creak in her sleep at anchor.</p>\n<p>From realisation to withdrawal. After a time, all those flaws are going to feel too overwhelming to cope with. Maybe you made a bad call? You want out? You might be getting frustrated, angry even. But you’ve committed now. There’s no easy ‘out’. No-one wants to buy an unloved boat. So, defeated, you’ll resort to apathy.</p>\n<p>“How’s the boat going?” your enthusiastic advisers will enquire, excited at the prospect of onboard sailing holidays (the real reason they all encouraged you to buy the boat).</p>\n<p>“Don’t even ask,” you reply, as you dream of dry earth, a house far from the sea, possibly becoming a farmer&#8230;</p>\n<p>So why go through this pain and misery? There are thousands of repeat offenders, who are into their second, third, even fourth boat marriage. There must be a good reason? Ah, the final stage: true love.

If you do it right, out of fury emerges an honest acceptance of one another and a sense of deep almost connection and love. Now you have the boat of your dreams.</p>\n<p>But dreams are never quite as imagined. The final stage: heartbreak. You lie awake at night worrying about her in a storm. You feel guilty for not maintaining her better. You reluctantly have to say no to other opportunities to spend time with her. She’ll be a tether, constantly pulling on your heart strings. And for many, many people this all gets too much to handle. And the boat goes up for sale.</p>\n<p>So, if the economics of a boat never add up. If owning a boat is painful, slow and full of bad surprises. If there is an exceptionally high neglect and divorce rate, then why buy a boat? Why risk the heartache?</p>\n<p>If you’re reading this you probably share my dream of sailing off into the sunset – perhaps on your own yacht. But is it worth it?</p>\n<p>In the end, to buy a boat or not comes down to the ‘why’. The ‘why’ must be greater than all the costs. And those costs are great. So identify what that reason is. What are your deep psychological needs that a boat can fulfil?

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Boat love is like any love: expensive, time consuming, and utterly hypnotic. And I have a problem. I have fallen in love with a boat.\n\nBeing a professional sailor, I realise how stupid this is, and I really should know better. From working for owners and using their credit cards to pay the bills, I know full well that the saying ‘owning a boat is like standing in a shower and ripping up bank notes’ rings true.\nI’ve now learned that process begins right at the purchase stage, because apparently it’s a rite of passage to buy a boat that’s triple your original budget…\nLike any sensible sailor, I called upon the advice of trusted friends, colleagues and clients. Should I buy the boat? Am I crazy?\nNaturally, I picked my advisers carefully: all people who would say ‘YES!’ Romantics, who don’t care for details. Remortgage my house? Sure! Spend a significant proportion of my income on berthing fees? Dreams are priceless!\nBoat infatuation is intoxicating. I’m coming to realise that buying a boat is like embarking on a new relationship. The first stage is the dreamy honeymoon phase. Your love can do no wrong! Even their flaws are endearing. Looking up at the deckhead, I saw some water damage. “Hmm, it looks like the deck is leaking. I’d probably enjoy replacing the teak.” Right…\nWhat happens next? The sugar coating will wear thin. Flaws become irritating, infuriating. Lesson 1: just like people we can’t expect boats to change. Especially older ones – they really get stuck in their ways.\nArticle continues below…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSecond hand boats: Buying a yacht to upgrade\nAmong brokerage listings it’s rare to see a yacht openly advertised as ‘work needed’. After an initial conversation, the potential…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nSecond hand boats: How to finance a yacht\nIf you are one of the many boat owners who buys with cash, then great – you can saunter on…\n\n\nSo, the second stage is one of realisation. Realising that her slow acceleration upwind wasn’t just a bad day; it’s who she fundamentally is. Understanding that she will never be as tidy as you want her to be. And, disappointingly, she will always – always – groan and creak in her sleep at anchor.\nFrom realisation to withdrawal. After a time, all those flaws are going to feel too overwhelming to cope with. Maybe you made a bad call? You want out? You might be getting frustrated, angry even. But you’ve committed now. There’s no easy ‘out’. No-one wants to buy an unloved boat. So, defeated, you’ll resort to apathy.\n“How’s the boat going?” your enthusiastic advisers will enquire, excited at the prospect of onboard sailing holidays (the real reason they all encouraged you to buy the boat).\n“Don’t even ask,” you reply, as you dream of dry earth, a house far from the sea, possibly becoming a farmer…\nSo why go through this pain and misery? There are thousands of repeat offenders, who are into their second, third, even fourth boat marriage. There must be a good reason? Ah, the final stage: true love. To pull in another cliché: ‘stormy seas make better sailors’.\n\nThe first phase of owning a boat is the ‘honeymoon phase’\n\nThe conflict, the aggravation, possibly depression, are all a necessary and unavoidable part of the process. If you do it right, out of fury emerges an honest acceptance of one another and a sense of deep almost connection and love. Now you have the boat of your dreams.\nBut dreams are never quite as imagined. The final stage: heartbreak. You lie awake at night worrying about her in a storm. You feel guilty for not maintaining her better. You reluctantly have to say no to other opportunities to spend time with her. She’ll be a tether, constantly pulling on your heart strings. And for many, many people this all gets too much to handle. And the boat goes up for sale.\nSo, if the economics of a boat never add up. If owning a boat is painful, slow and full of bad surprises. If there is an exceptionally high neglect and divorce rate, then why buy a boat? Why risk the heartache?\nIf you’re reading this you probably share my dream of sailing off into the sunset – perhaps on your own yacht. But is it worth it?\nIn the end, to buy a boat or not comes down to the ‘why’. The ‘why’ must be greater than all the costs. And those costs are great. So identify what that reason is. What are your deep psychological needs that a boat can fulfil? For me, it’s freedom, adventure, and beauty.\nI hope the boat I end up buying will align with my values, help me be my best self, and be an extension of my soul. So, ask yourself: why? And if you have an answer, if it comes from a passion that runs deep in your veins, then welcome to the club. We share the same problem!\nIf you enjoyed this….\nYachting World is the world’s leading magazine for bluewater cruisers and offshore sailors.

There is also a secondary, shorter fuel take off from the diesel fuel tank.</p></div>\n<p>I live on my boat all year round, come rain, hale, snow and heat wave. The climate I live in lends itself to having some reliable heating fitted.</p>\n<p>I bought a second hand Taylors Paraffin heater for one of my boats, after paying for it to be professionally serviced and important bits replaced, it was still slightly less expensive than new, but not by much. Apart from the cost of buying the unit, you should factor in the cost of professional installation too.</p>\n<p>I chose a Taylors paraffin heater for my older sailing boat because it requires no electricity at all. I have to hand pump a small tank to bring it up to pressure so that the fuel flows. I chose paraffin over the diesel option because it requires a smaller flu out of the coach roof and smaller pipework internally too.  But it&#8217;s a faff compared to pressing an igniter button and having hot air pumped around the place which is what you get with a blown air heater. The downside is that they need some electricity to keep working and they&#8217;re noisy, especially for the neighbours who have to put up with the exhaust noise. To install a blown air heater on my newer sail boat is easier than the paraffin heater though as it was made with pre cut or pre marked holes for ducting under some of the furniture as it was an optional extra when the boat was new and unlike the older boat, there&#8217;s no spare bulkhead on which it could be mounted .</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a few second hand heaters on the market. Make sure if you do buy something second hand, that you get it professionally serviced and also when running any kind of combustible burner inside your boat ensure you have a good quality carbon monoxide detector fitted to your boat.</p>\n<p>It can be very tempting to try one of the very low priced copies of the real deal heaters from Webasto or Eberspacher. A good number of the low-cost, often cloned diesel forced air heaters available online do not conform to UK or EU laws and regulations.<br />\nMost budget diesel forced air heaters were originally designed for trucks or motorhomes, which have different requirements and are not subjected to such a harsh corrosive environment as that found in a sea-going yacht.</p>\n<blockquote><p><em><strong>Buyer beware.<br />\nI always recommend trusted heater manufacturers/brands with certified warranties and customer service backup. Buying a diesel heater intended for use in road vehicles rather than boats, or a diesel heater that does not meet UK safety standards, could pose a risk to life.<br />\nI also highly recommend that any combustible heater is professionally installed by a recognised and certified installation professional.<br />\nAll of the heaters in my buyer&#8217;s guide to the best diesel heaters below have the capacity to produce and fill your cabin with carbon monoxide if incorrectly fitted or poorly maintained.  The consequences can be fatal. </strong></em></p></blockquote>\n<h2>If you want heating you can trust then here&#8217;s my guide to the best diesel heaters for boats</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve divided this guide into two sections, with the best boat heaters for boats up to 38 foot and the best diesel heaters for boats over 40 foot.</p>\n<h2>The best Diesel heaters for boats up to 38 foot</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-92391\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2021/07/617gG6Mz7L._AC_SX679_-525x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"525\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/gear/eberspacher-s2-d2l-diesel-heater-tested-79190\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eberspacher Espar Airtronic S2 D2 L 12V 2.2kW (7500BTU) with EasyStart PRO 7 Day Timer</a></h2>\n<p>Specifications: heat output 2 kW, Fuel type: diesel, power: 12v or 24v, Fuel Consumption: Approx. 0.12 &#8211; 0.24 liters per hour, Dimensions (L 362 x W132 x H150 mm (approximately 14.25&#8243; x 5.2&#8243; x 5.9&#8243;), Weight: 2.7 kg (approximately 5.9 lbs) Noise Level: Operating noise: ~45 dB(A) at a distance of 1 meter,</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons you&#8217;ll like it<br />\n</strong>Simple push button start, easy to adjust temperature output, thermostatically controlled, tidy barely visible installation</p>\n<p><strong>Something to be aware of<br />\n</strong>This type of heater can be noisy for your neighbours, they require regular qualified maintenance</p>\n<p><strong>What I think of it</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most popular manufactures of best diesel heaters for boats , <a href=\"https://www.yachtingmonthly.com/gear/eberspacher-s2-d2l-diesel-heater-tested-79190\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eberspacher</a>, has recently upgraded its Airtronic heaters, giving them a power boost mode for fast initial heating plus continuously variable temperature settings.</p>\n<p>They also now have a fresh air mode to improve air circulation through the boat on warm days. Years of continual development has made these heaters more economical, quieter and more importantly, reliable.</p>\n<p>Most boats that I have skippered professionally have been fitted with one of these blow air heaters.

between cost and quality, although there seems to be little difference in the latter to the higher-priced brands.</p>\n<p>Planar’s UK distributor is currently small, yet it holds a full range of spare parts (unlike many of the cheaper Chinese models) and the reviews on its service have so far been excellent.</p>\n<p>Its Autoterm Air marine range comprises a 2kW and 4kW heater; however, larger units can be made specifically to suit.</p>\n<p>The standard kit comes with a basic rotary control panel offering stop/start, capacity and air temp control and LED indication of heater status.</p>\n<p>The next level has an additional seven-day timer, ventilation mode and an LCD for temperature indication.</p>\n<p>Finally, there’s a GSM modem option with smartphone app for remote operation via the mobile phone network.</p>\n<p>This offers all the features of the more advanced LCD control panel, only on your smartphone.</p>\n<p><a

heater</h2>\n<p><strong>Specifications: </strong>Fuel Type: Diesel, Voltage: None (This is a gravity-fed system, so it doesn&#8217;t require an electrical supply for operation), Heating Output: Max 3.0 kW Min 1.0 kW, Fuel Consumption: Max 0.25 litres per hour, Min 0.10 litres per hour, Dimensions: Height: 325 mm (12.8 inches) Width: 310 mm (12.2 inches) Depth: 365 mm (14.4 inches) Weight: Approx. 9.5 kg (20.9 lbs)</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons you&#8217;ll like it<br />\n</strong>It&#8217;s is a very simple heater and easy to maintain, silent running, requires no electricity</p>\n<p><strong>Something to be aware of<br />\n</strong>lighting it takes a few minutes, you will need to cut a hole in your roof for the flu, severe/adverse weather can cause a bit of blowback</p>\n<p><strong>What I think of it</strong></p>\n<p>The Refleks Danish made stoves are popular with more traditional year round cruisers. Seen in working boats, fishing boats and a wide array of sail boats and traditional motor cruisers, the Refleks diesel heaters are king of the cold. They&#8217;re sturdy drip fed units that radiate heat rather than blow it around.</p>\n<p>The larger Refleks stove heater models have additional internal pipework that allows further radiator heat or hot water heating. This small unit is the most basic and most budget friendly though and considered practically bomb proof.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll see Refleks heaters on board many boats, quietly kicking heat out. You&#8217;ll see a larger model on board Skip Novaks Vinson of Antartica, but you&#8217;ll also see a tiny model, such as this one I&#8217;ve shown here in just about every boatman cabin on the barges working the canals of Netherlands and Holland. I do rather like this little video about how to start one by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_DeyphzhBs\">Sail Life on YouTube</a><br />\nMy friends with a Jeanneau Sunshine 38 had one of these and I spent some lovely evenings sitting by it in the depths of a British winter. Only occasionally did we get a little pop of blowback when the wind was howling. I think that&#8217;s remedied with a better baffled flu top cowl.</p>\n<p>The advantage of the drip fed heaters is that you don&#8217;t get the loud exhaust noise associated with blown air diesel heaters.</p>\n<p>Total heat output: 1.6 kW (1400 kcal/h)<br />\nFuel consumption: min. 0.12 l/h<br />\nFuel consumption: max. 0.30 l/h<br />\nThis one is for area volume sizes of approx. 14 &#8211; 23 Cu.

The other difference between the two versions of the same heater is that the paraffin heater uses a smaller diameter flu.

It also has scope to allow heated towel rails and radiators that give a different type of heat to blown air. It can still be used for blown air too, through a heat exchanger, so if you like that sort of thing in your wet locker to dry your wet foul wet gear then it has you covered.

So, if you want two outlets, you’ll need to measure carefully and price it in, along with a grill and a T-piece connector (£60).</p>\n<p>Many owners now fit silencers to the fresh air intake as well, to quieten the ‘roar’ heard with older models, plus anti- vibration rubber mounts to lessen the sound of the fuel pump are also available.</p>\n<p>Continues below&#8230;</p>\n\n\n<div id=\"accordion\" class=\"collection-wrapper  \">\n\n\t\n</div>\n\n<p>The cost can increase if you want a fancy controller, too.</p>\n<p>They usually come with just an analogue rotary-type knob with an LED or two to indicate operation status.</p>\n<p>While this might suit some, others may want a remote panel with an LCD to show what’s going on (£150- £200), or even control via their phone.</p>\n<p>Don’t be fooled by the ‘free’ app though, it’ll only work if the heater is connected to the GSM network, and that involves buying a modem and a SIM card (£200-£300, plus around £7.50/ month for the SIM).</p>\n<p>If you get an advanced control box it’s worth fitting a temperature sensor. Finally, check how long the standard control cable is, as an extension can sometimes mean it’s cheaper and easier to opt for a wireless remote (£150).</p>\n<h2>Marine heater safety</h2>\n<p>Many of these heaters are designed for vehicles and don’t always list a specific marine kit.</p>\n<p>Check the kit contains enough lagging to double-lag the exhaust and make sure the exhaust outlet is stainless or bronze and angled up to allow for a swan-neck in the pipe to eliminate back-feed of water.</p>\n<p>It is also worth double checking the kit is marine specific.</p>\n<p>Automotive heaters are designed to be fitted externally, so do not require the same standard of air-tightness on the joins around the exhaust and on the welds around the silencer.</p>\n<p>Similarly, metal fittings may be galvanised rather than stainless steel, and vulnerable to rust, and fuel lines not of the same specification.</p>\n<p>The critical safety issue is that of carbon monoxide.</p>\n<p>A properly installed heating system will run without issue, but as we’ve seen too often, an exhaust leak or other fault can be fatal.</p>\n<p>All boats should have a CO alarm anyway, but check yours is in date and working.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/gear-reviews/best-diesel-heaters-for-boats-an-expert-buyers-guide-156348\">Best diesel heaters for boats &#8211; An expert buyer&#8217;s guide</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com\">Yachting World</a>.</p>\n",
    "content:encodedSnippet": "The best diesel heaters for boats have seen some great improvements over the past few years. They're the most common form of heating onboard sail boats and motorboats. Full time British liveaboard for over 20 years and hardy Northerner, Fox Morgan talks through some of the most popular options for liveaboards, year round cruising and sailing at higher latitudes\n\nBest diesel heaters for boats – This buyer’s guide was first published online in 2021 – it was revised and updated 14 Jan 2025\n\nThis Dehler 36 CWS suits easy fitment of diesel blown air heating, as it came pre marked with ducting holes and vents. There is also a secondary, shorter fuel take off from the diesel fuel tank.\n\nI live on my boat all year round, come rain, hale, snow and heat wave. The climate I live in lends itself to having some reliable heating fitted.\nI bought a second hand Taylors Paraffin heater for one of my boats, after paying for it to be professionally serviced and important bits replaced, it was still slightly less expensive than new, but not by much. Apart from the cost of buying the unit, you should factor in the cost of professional installation too.\nI chose a Taylors paraffin heater for my older sailing boat because it requires no electricity at all. I have to hand pump a small tank to bring it up to pressure so that the fuel flows. I chose paraffin over the diesel option because it requires a smaller flu out of the coach roof and smaller pipework internally too.  But it’s a faff compared to pressing an igniter button and having hot air pumped around the place which is what you get with a blown air heater. The downside is that they need some electricity to keep working and they’re noisy, especially for the neighbours who have to put up with the exhaust noise. To install a blown air heater on my newer sail boat is easier than the paraffin heater though as it was made with pre cut or pre marked holes for ducting under some of the furniture as it was an optional extra when the boat was new and unlike the older boat, there’s no spare bulkhead on which it could be mounted .\nThere’s a few second hand heaters on the market. Make sure if you do buy something second hand, that you get it professionally serviced and also when running any kind of combustible burner inside your boat ensure you have a good quality carbon monoxide detector fitted to your boat.\nIt can be very tempting to try one of the very low priced copies of the real deal heaters from Webasto or Eberspacher. A good number of the low-cost, often cloned diesel forced air heaters available online do not conform to UK or EU laws and regulations.\nBuyer beware.\n\n\nIf you want heating you can trust then here’s my guide to the best diesel heaters for boats\nI’ve divided this guide into two sections, with the best boat heaters for boats up to 38 foot and the best diesel heaters for boats over 40 foot.\nThe best Diesel heaters for boats up to 38 foot\n \n\nEberspacher Espar Airtronic S2 D2 L 12V 2.2kW (7500BTU) with EasyStart PRO 7 Day Timer\nSpecifications: heat output 2 kW, Fuel type: diesel, power: 12v or 24v, Fuel Consumption: Approx. 0.12 – 0.24 liters per hour, Dimensions (L 362 x W132 x H150 mm (approximately 14.25″ x 5.2″ x 5.9″), Weight: 2.7 kg (approximately 5.9 lbs) Noise Level: Operating noise: ~45 dB(A) at a distance of 1 meter,\nReasons you’ll like it\nSimple push button start, easy to adjust temperature output, thermostatically controlled, tidy barely visible installation\nSomething to be aware of\nThis type of heater can be noisy for your neighbours, they require regular qualified maintenance\nWhat I think of it\nOne of the most popular manufactures of best diesel heaters for boats , Eberspacher, has recently upgraded its Airtronic heaters, giving them a power boost mode for fast initial heating plus continuously variable temperature settings.\nThey also now have a fresh air mode to improve air circulation through the boat on warm days. Years of continual development has made these heaters more economical, quieter and more importantly, reliable.\nMost boats that I have skippered professionally have been fitted with one of these blow air heaters. The best are the ones with fully working thermostats easy timers for on and off operation. Meaning you can go off the to the pub and set it on a timer to warm the boat shortly before your planned return. Or you can set it to go off automatically after a set amount of time, such as when you go the bed.\nThe wide range of controls on offer includes various panels with switches and LCDs, or there’s the latest, EasyStart Call, which allows you to operate your heater using the proprietary smartphone app.\nThe app turns your phone screen into a simulated control panel and transmits your selected settings to a GSM module installed in the heater.\nModels include the Airtronic D2 and S2 D2L (<32ft LOA), D4+ and M2 D4L (26-39ft), D5 (36-49ft) and the D8LC (49-62ft).\nBuy it now from Amazon\n\n \nNote: We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site, at no extra cost to you.

The two are very similar to use and really the choices of which to go with depends on your local service centres and availability of spares in your territory/location.\nWebasto are known as one of the leading manufacturers of best diesel heaters for boats and appear much the same as Eberspacher heaters… but they are different and have small differences.\nFor larger yachts there’s the high-output, multi-mode Airtop Evo 3900 (<40ft) or 50 (<50ft).\nBoth are powerful, yet quiet and economical and can be controlled using a MultiControl, a TeleStart wireless remote pad or via a mobile phone app using its ThermoCall system.\nThe temperature is regulated using intelligent blower control whereby the heater output and fan controls are separately sensed to reduce power and fuel consumption.\nThe Evo series has also been upgraded with ECO mode for reduced electrical power consumption, Boost mode for maximum output and Ventilation mode to provide fresh air to the cabins on a hot day.\nBuy it now at Amazon\n\n \n\nWallas 22GB Coastal Kit\nSpecifications: Fuel Type: Diesel, Voltage: 12V DC, Power Output: Max 2.4 kW, Min 1.0 kW, Fuel Consumption:Max 0.24 litres per hour, Min 0.10 litres per hour,  Dimensions Length: 458 mm (18 inches) Width: 210 mm (8.3 inches) Height: 168 mm (6.6 inches), Weight: Approx. 5.5 kg (12.1 lbs), Noise Level: Approximate noise level: 47-50 dB\nReasons you’ll like it\nSimple push button start, easy to adjust temperature output, thermostatically controlled, tidy barely visible installation\nSomething to be aware of\nThis type of heater can be noisy for your neighbours, they require regular qualified maintenance\nWhat I think of it\nWallas recently updated its 2.2kW (22GB) and 3.2kW (30GB) Nautic models by changing their blower motors to brushless types.\nThe result is more power and output capacity, allowing the boat to heat up quickly, efficiently and quietly.\nIts new laminar flow burner offers low emissions of CO2 and NOx, and is designed to work with blended bio-diesel.\nRenewable materials are used in its construction, although it retains high-grade aluminium components where necessary.\nThe new control panel offers smooth PI-controlled thermostat adjustment and two-step air boost protection against accidental operation.\nBuy from Kuranda\n\nLike most systems now, Planar heaters can be controlled via your phone\n\nAutoterm BOAT Diesel Heater 2 kW Medium\nSpecifications: Fuel Type: Diesel, Voltage: 12V DC or 24V DC (depending on configuration) Heating Output: Max 2.2 kW Min 1.0 kW Fuel Consumption: Maximum fuel consumption: 0.24 liters per hour (at full power) Minimum fuel consumption: 0.10 liters per hour (at low power) Dimensions: Length: 360 mm (14.2 inches) Width: 130 mm (5.1 inches) Height: 150 mm (5.9 inches), Weight: Approx. 3.5 kg (7.7 lbs), Noise Level: 40-45 dB(A) at 1 meter\nReasons you’ll like it\nSimple push button start, easy to adjust temperature output, barely visible installation, spares are easy to find and low cost\nSomething to be aware of\nThis type of heater can be noisy for your neighbours, they require regular maintenance\nWhat I think of it\nNew kid on the block, Latvian-built Planar heaters appear to be a genuine compromise between cost and quality, although there seems to be little difference in the latter to the higher-priced brands.\nPlanar’s UK distributor is currently small, yet it holds a full range of spare parts (unlike many of the cheaper Chinese models) and the reviews on its service have so far been excellent.\nIts Autoterm Air marine range comprises a 2kW and 4kW heater; however, larger units can be made specifically to suit.\nThe standard kit comes with a basic rotary control panel offering stop/start, capacity and air temp control and LED indication of heater status.\nThe next level has an additional seven-day timer, ventilation mode and an LCD for temperature indication.\nFinally, there’s a GSM modem option with smartphone app for remote operation via the mobile phone network.\nThis offers all the features of the more advanced LCD control panel, only on your smartphone.\nBuy it Now\n\nRefleks Stove Heater Refleks 11032-66M heater\nSpecifications: Fuel Type: Diesel, Voltage: None (This is a gravity-fed system, so it doesn’t require an electrical supply for operation), Heating Output: Max 3.0 kW Min 1.0 kW, Fuel Consumption: Max 0.25 litres per hour, Min 0.10 litres per hour, Dimensions: Height: 325 mm (12.8 inches) Width: 310 mm (12.2 inches) Depth: 365 mm (14.4 inches) Weight: Approx. 9.5 kg (20.9 lbs)\nReasons you’ll like it\nIt’s is a very simple heater and easy to maintain, silent running, requires no electricity\nSomething to be aware of\nlighting it takes a few minutes, you will need to cut a hole in your roof for the flu, severe/adverse weather can cause a bit of blowback\nWhat I think of it\nThe Refleks Danish made stoves are popular with more traditional year round cruisers. Seen in working boats, fishing boats and a wide array of sail boats and traditional motor cruisers, the Refleks diesel heaters are king of the cold. They’re sturdy drip fed units that radiate heat rather than blow it around.\nThe larger Refleks stove heater models have additional internal pipework that allows further radiator heat or hot water heating. This small unit is the most basic and most budget friendly though and considered practically bomb proof.\nYou’ll see Refleks heaters on board many boats, quietly kicking heat out. You’ll see a larger model on board Skip Novaks Vinson of Antartica, but you’ll also see a tiny model, such as this one I’ve shown here in just about every boatman cabin on the barges working the canals of Netherlands and Holland. I do rather like this little video about how to start one by Sail Life on YouTube\nThe advantage of the drip fed heaters is that you don’t get the loud exhaust noise associated with blown air diesel heaters.\nTotal heat output: 1.6 kW (1400 kcal/h)\nfor more info on Refleks heaters go to the manufacturer site\n\n\nTaylors Paraffin Heater 079K\nSpecifications: Fuel Type: Paraffin (Kerosene), Power Output: 1.5-3.5 kW, Fuel Consumption: Max: 0.3 litres per hour, Min: 0.1 litres per hour, Dimensions: Height: 430 mm (17 inches)Width: 270 mm (10.6 inches) Depth: 300 mm (12 inches)\nReasons you’ll like it\nQuiet when in use, radiates heat, simple and easy to maintain, requires no electricity, will last decades with minimal maintenance and can be used for days/weeks at a time without need for any specialist expertise.\nSomething to be aware of\nYou will need to fit a flu through the top of your boat, you will need a bulkhead to mount it on, you will need to add a heat proof back plate, it requires a little effort to light it\nWhat I think of it\nThe classic looking heater comes in two forms, one uses diesel (see below) and one uses paraffin or kerosene. There’s a few little differences between the two. Primarily there’s the fuel delivery.\nThe Taylors heater is a superbly simple heater for boats. Fitted to a bulkhead the heater radiates heat rather than pumps hot air around ducting. As such it is virtually silent running.\nFront opening door gives access for lighting it, maintenance or adjustment and it comes with the tank, pressure gauge and hand pump built in.\nExternally vented and bulkhead mounted, through-deck fitting flue sections are also supplied.\nAvailable in a brass or a Stainless Steel finish.\nAn excellent choice for anyone wanting to live aboard or use their boat year round. This model suits a smaller boat up to 38 foot.\nYou can buy spares for them from Blakes Taylor based in the UK near Southampton \nBuy it now from Ebay 1\nBuy it now from Ebay 2\n\nTaylors Diesel Heater 079D\nSpecifications: Fuel Type: Diesel, Voltage: 12V DC, Power Output: 3.0 kW, Fuel Consumption: Maximum: 0.35 litres per hour, Minimum: 0.15 litres per hour, Dimensions: Length: 500 mm (19.7 inches) Width: 380 mm (15 inches) Height: 330 mm (13 inches) Weight: Approximately 14 kg (30.9 lbs) Materials: Stainless Steel\nReasons you’ll like it\nQuiet when in use, radiates heat, simple and easy to maintain, requires no electricity\nSomething to be aware of\nYou will need to fit a flu through the top of your boat, it requires a little effort to light it\nWhat I think of it\nFuelled by red or clear diesel, fed from from its own gravity tank – Header tank version – or pumped direct from the boat’s supply – main fuel tank version.\nIt is a superbly simple heater for boats. Fitted to a bulkhead the heater radiates heat rather than pumps hot air around ducting. As a gravity fed unit this is virtually silent running.\nFront opening door gives access for maintenance or adjustment, Supplied with a 1.5 gallon tank, a safety on/off fuel control valve, in-line fuel filter, pipe work and fittings for installation,\nExternally vented and bulkhead mounted, through-deck fitting flue sections are also supplied.\nAvailable in a brass or a Stainless Steel finish.\nAn excellent choice for anyone wanting to live aboard or use their boat year round. This model suits a smaller boat up to 38 foot.\nBuy it from Marine Store\nAs Taylors are no longer making these due to a loss of engineering skills in the UK, they do still provide spares, so, as such you can just about build your own from the spares. Ebay can be a good source for second hand Taylors heaters.\nBlakes Taylor based in the UK near Southampton \n \nThe best Diesel heaters for boats over 40 foot\n \n\nA digital timer offers instant access to functions\n\nWebasto Air Top Evo 3900 Marine Heater\nSpecifications: Heating Output: max 3.9 kW min 1.6kW, Fuel Type: Diesel (can be connected to the boat’s main fuel tank), Voltage Supply: 12V or 24V DC (depending on model), Power Consumption (Electrical): Start-up: 8 A (initial surge), Operation: Approx. 2.5 A at 12V, 1.25 A at 24V, Fuel Consumption: Maximum consumption: 0.38 l/h, Minimum consumption: 0.15 l/h, Dimensions Length: 356 mm (14 inches) Width: 122 mm (4.8 inches) Height: 144 mm (5.7 inches), Weight: Approx. 4.5 kg (9.9 lbs), Noise Level: Operating noise: ~45 dB(A) at a distance of 1 meter\nReasons you’ll like it\nSimple push button start, easy to adjust temperature output, thermostatically controlled, tidy barely visible installation\nSomething to be aware of\nThis type of heater can be noisy for your neighbours, they require regular maintenance\nWhat I think of it\nWebasto’s steplessly modulated heating systems are renowned for their high build quality, performance and reliability.\nThe range features numerous safety devices and procedures, including flame detection and exhaust heat sensing, to ensure safe operation.\nThe new MultiControl digital timer/temp controller offers instant access to functions plus a quick start button and is sealed against water ingress.\nECO mode for reduced electric consumption, power mode PLUS for +10% more heat output (from 3,500 W to 3,900 W) and ventilation mode to supply fresh, cold air to the interior on hot days.\nIt is supplied with a universal marine kit which includes copper fuel piping and appropriate connections, fittings for installation and rotary controller.

Most of the carbon monoxide detectors that give a readout on a screen built in are intended for RV’s and camper vans and usually aren’t sold for boats.\n \n\n \n\nDuncan Kent says…\nCommon issues are incorrectly designed exhausts, corrosive steel clips, screws and brackets, plastic fuel lines and filters, and non-watertight casings.\nSome really cheap models lack thermal sensors, overheat alarms and shutdown modes, thereby presenting a very real risk of an onboard fire should the heat outlet accidentally be covered by a carelessly placed sail bag or drooping sleeping bag.\nThere’s also the possibility of carbon monoxide entering the boat if a fender is left dangling over the exhaust while the heater is running, or if the silencer is of poor quality with crimped, rather than welded seams.\nAll these are very typical scenarios found on a cruising yacht and highlight the need for the appropriate, built-in safety devices listed in the regulations.\nRecent advances in diesel forced air heaters\nAs with most marine equipment, heating systems have been subject to gradual improvement over the past decade, both in regard to technical features and from a safety point of view.\nMany are also now more economical on fuel and efficient on output, and the introduction of brushless fan motors has resulted in them using less electrical power and running much more quietly.\nNew glow ‘pins’ rather than the older style glow ‘plugs’ have greatly improved fuel burn efficiency too and gone a long way towards eliminating ‘coking up’.\nMany recent diesel heater models now have a boost function just to pre-warm the boat and an eco-setting in which it just ticks over enough to retain the temperature within a narrow range.\nThere has also been a good deal of improvement in the controls.\nIn the past they’ve been simple electro-mechanical devices with either a rheostat or multi-way switch to select the temperature range.\nThen along came more accurate controls with LCD displays and built-in seven-day timers.\nNow, there are wireless remotes on offer and you can even control heaters by mobile app or online, so that you can switch the heater on when you’re a few miles away and climb aboard a toasty boat whatever the weather.\nHow much will a diesel forced air heater cost me?\nIt’s important to work out what you need for your installation before attempting to compare prices.\nMost kits come with enough bits for a single outlet and the minimal amount of ducting. So, if you want two outlets, you’ll need to measure carefully and price it in, along with a grill and a T-piece connector (£60).\nMany owners now fit silencers to the fresh air intake as well, to quieten the ‘roar’ heard with older models, plus anti- vibration rubber mounts to lessen the sound of the fuel pump are also available.\nContinues below…\nThe cost can increase if you want a fancy controller, too.\nThey usually come with just an analogue rotary-type knob with an LED or two to indicate operation status.\nWhile this might suit some, others may want a remote panel with an LCD to show what’s going on (£150- £200), or even control via their phone.\nDon’t be fooled by the ‘free’ app though, it’ll only work if the heater is connected to the GSM network, and that involves buying a modem and a SIM card (£200-£300, plus around £7.50/ month for the SIM).\nIf you get an advanced control box it’s worth fitting a temperature sensor. Finally, check how long the standard control cable is, as an extension can sometimes mean it’s cheaper and easier to opt for a wireless remote (£150).\nMarine heater safety\nMany of these heaters are designed for vehicles and don’t always list a specific marine kit.\nCheck the kit contains enough lagging to double-lag the exhaust and make sure the exhaust outlet is stainless or bronze and angled up to allow for a swan-neck in the pipe to eliminate back-feed of water.\nIt is also worth double checking the kit is marine specific.\nAutomotive heaters are designed to be fitted externally, so do not require the same standard of air-tightness on the joins around the exhaust and on the welds around the silencer.\nSimilarly, metal fittings may be galvanised rather than stainless steel, and vulnerable to rust, and fuel lines not of the same specification.\nThe critical safety issue is that of carbon monoxide.\nA properly installed heating system will run without issue, but as we’ve seen too often, an exhaust leak or other fault can be fatal.\nAll boats should have a CO alarm anyway, but check yours is in date and working.\n \nThe post Best diesel heaters for boats – An expert buyer’s guide appeared first on Yachting World.",

His vessels are Hornpipe, a sail and oar boat to a design by local British Columbia designer Don Kurylko, and Fire-Drake, a two-masted, unballasted open boat of great beauty which he designed and built himself, propelled by oars or balanced lug sails.</p>\n<p>His sailing ground is the glorious coast of British Columbia and his book, Becoming Coastal, describes a quarter-century of cruising these remarkable waters in which he learns as much about himself as the nature that surrounds him and the ways of his lovely boats in salt water.</p>\n<p>In his introduction, he remarks that ‘self-propelled exploration provides that sense of immediacy that affirms to you that you are living your own life.’ He contrasts this with the increasing tendency to exist in a virtual world, or one isolated from reality by, for example, a car windscreen.</p>\n<p>There is much in what he says, and he rounds up this philosophy by observing that it comes down to wanting to be alive when he dies, not just putting in time until the machine winds down. This is heady stuff, and his descriptions of the sailing are equally pithy.</p>\n<p>In the extract below, Zimmerman and Hornpipe are engaged in a ‘raid’, that is, a rally of small open craft travelling more or less in company. The weather serves him up a lively day and his handling of the potentially awkward lug sails in an eminently capsizable boat makes me wonder how I might have fared myself. Read on, and see how you might’ve managed&#8230;&lt;/en?</p>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-156463\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.GSM_zimmerman.Zimmerman_cover-320x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.GSM_zimmerman.Zimmerman_cover-320x400.jpg 320w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.GSM_zimmerman.Zimmerman_cover-160x200.jpg 160w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.GSM_zimmerman.Zimmerman_cover-400x500.jpg 400w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/01/YAW305.GSM_zimmerman.Zimmerman_cover.jpg 1133w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" />Extract from Becoming Coastal</h2>\n<p>That night at anchor in Pilot Bay, I rig the tarp over the boat again and turn in to sleep. The night is unsettled, with the wind sending small wavelets into the bay, making for a jerky rocking motion.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t keep me awake for long though. All goes well until about 0230 in the morning when a few gusts come up. They start pushing the boat around on its anchor line and flapping the tarp enough that I can’t sleep in the snapping and banging noise it makes. I get up and take it down, spending the rest of night with it draped over me as a cover to keep the dew off.</p>\n<p>While I am unrigging the tarp, there is an amazing show of bioluminescence in the water, as the waves disturb the luminous small sea creatures. If I wasn’t so tired, it would have been worth<br />\na swim just to see the light show.</p>\n<p>Sunday morning dawns clear, and the wind has shifted overnight to a light south-east breeze with a forecast of more wind to come later in the day. This is welcome news, as we face the longest leg of the raid. It’s 22 miles north-north-west across the Strait of Georgia to our destination on Jedediah Island.</p>\n<p>This suits me fine, as it means we will be on a broad reach most of the day, which seems so far to be Hornpipe’s best point of sail. After breakfast and the skippers’ meeting, we organise ourselves for the start, with the boats gliding back and forth across the bay under easy sail in the bright morning sun.</p>\n<h2>Wind on the turn</h2>\n<p>The start horn goes off and we sheet in our sails for the short beat out of the bay. Once outside, we settle in to getting the best performance out of our boats in the light air downwind. Those boats with spinnakers fly them and the rest of us pay close attention to our steering and sail trim.</p>\n<p>I actually pass one of the Wayfarer dinghies, feeling good about it, only to find out later that they have neglected to raise their centreboard, which causes extra drag and slows them down.</p>\n<p>The breeze begins to turn into a real wind sometime around about 1130. It occurs to me that if this is the start of the predicted stronger wind later in the afternoon, now will be a good time to eat my lunch before I get too busy. It’s a good strategy, as soon after that the wind gets stronger and I keep busy reefing the sails to reduce the area.</p>\n<p><em>Article continues below&#8230;</em></p>\n\n\n<div id=\"accordion\" class=\"collection-wrapper list-large \">\n\n\t\t\t\t<article class=\"loop loop-list-large row post-155508 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-features tag-great-seamanship tag-top-stories publication_name-yachting-world loop-even loop-24 featured-image\" role=\"article\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6 entry-media\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/features/great-seamanship-ancestor-a-carriacou-sloops-voyage-to-vancouver-155508\" rel=\"bookmark\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/11/YAW301.GSM_ancestor.033neargalapogas.jpg\" class=\" wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/11/YAW301.GSM_ancestor.033neargalapogas.jpg 2000w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/11/YAW301.GSM_ancestor.033neargalapogas-300x169.jpg 300w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/11/YAW301.GSM_ancestor.033neargalapogas-630x354.jpg 630w, https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2024/11/YAW301.GSM_ancestor.033neargalapogas-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" data-image-id=\"155513\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"col-xs-12 col-sm-6\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://www.yachtingworld.com/features/great-seamanship-ancestor-a-carriacou-sloops-voyage-to-vancouver-155508\" rel=\"bookmark\">Great Seamanship: Ancestor – A Carriacou Sloop’s Voyage to Vancouver</a></h2>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</header>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\n                            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Not many years ago I was privileged to become involved with the vernacular sloops of the Windward Islands while on&hellip;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</article>\n\n\t\t\t\n</div><!-- /#accordion -->\n\n<p>Reefing the standing lug sails that comprise Hornpipe’s rig involves dropping the whole sail into the boat, shifting the tack pennant, tying in the reef points as you come aft, then shifting the sheet to the reef clew.

Within 20 minutes the wind increases again to the point where I have to take the first reef in the mainsail. The boat is again more manageable but within another 20 minutes the wind rises again to the point where I need the second reef in the main.</p>\n<p>The wind keeps rising until finally I drop the mizzen sail altogether. By the time I am down to just the double-reefed main in early afternoon, we have made a lot of progress across the Strait, and don’t have far to go. The wind, however, is really strong and, more to the point, the sea state is beginning to catch up to it.</p>\n<p>I estimate the wind to be 20 knots with gusts higher than that. We find out later that this is wrong, that the wind is in fact a steady 30 knots, gusting to at least 34, on the edge of being a gale.

Photo: c/o Alex Zimmerman</p></div>\n<p>Waves by now are routinely 4-6ft high, with occasional waves to 8ft. At the bottom of the wave troughs I can’t see over the tops. The day remains clear and sunny though, and with the sea sparkling blue in the sunshine, the foam showing bright white from the breaking waves and the snow-capped peaks on the mainland shore shining in the distance, it is irrepressibly beautiful. It is hard to feel properly apprehensive about the high wind.</p>\n<p>Hornpipe is essentially a rowboat and, with its tucked up transom, it is a displacement hull. I find out then that the boat will in fact surf.

    "content:encodedSnippet": "Sailing a small boat alone in a rising wind and growing seas, Alex Zimmerman battles to reach shelter. Tom Cunliffe introduces this extract from Becoming Coastal\n\nAlex Zimmerman gives us a new perspective on small boat seafaring. His vessels are Hornpipe, a sail and oar boat to a design by local British Columbia designer Don Kurylko, and Fire-Drake, a two-masted, unballasted open boat of great beauty which he designed and built himself, propelled by oars or balanced lug sails.\nHis sailing ground is the glorious coast of British Columbia and his book, Becoming Coastal, describes a quarter-century of cruising these remarkable waters in which he learns as much about himself as the nature that surrounds him and the ways of his lovely boats in salt water.\nIn his introduction, he remarks that ‘self-propelled exploration provides that sense of immediacy that affirms to you that you are living your own life.’ He contrasts this with the increasing tendency to exist in a virtual world, or one isolated from reality by, for example, a car windscreen.\nThere is much in what he says, and he rounds up this philosophy by observing that it comes down to wanting to be alive when he dies, not just putting in time until the machine winds down. This is heady stuff, and his descriptions of the sailing are equally pithy.\nIn the extract below, Zimmerman and Hornpipe are engaged in a ‘raid’, that is, a rally of small open craft travelling more or less in company. The weather serves him up a lively day and his handling of the potentially awkward lug sails in an eminently capsizable boat makes me wonder how I might have fared myself. Read on, and see how you might’ve managed…</en?\nExtract from Becoming Coastal\nThat night at anchor in Pilot Bay, I rig the tarp over the boat again and turn in to sleep. The night is unsettled, with the wind sending small wavelets into the bay, making for a jerky rocking motion.\nIt doesn’t keep me awake for long though. All goes well until about 0230 in the morning when a few gusts come up. They start pushing the boat around on its anchor line and flapping the tarp enough that I can’t sleep in the snapping and banging noise it makes. I get up and take it down, spending the rest of night with it draped over me as a cover to keep the dew off.\nWhile I am unrigging the tarp, there is an amazing show of bioluminescence in the water, as the waves disturb the luminous small sea creatures. If I wasn’t so tired, it would have been worth\nSunday morning dawns clear, and the wind has shifted overnight to a light south-east breeze with a forecast of more wind to come later in the day. This is welcome news, as we face the longest leg of the raid. It’s 22 miles north-north-west across the Strait of Georgia to our destination on Jedediah Island.\nThis suits me fine, as it means we will be on a broad reach most of the day, which seems so far to be Hornpipe’s best point of sail. After breakfast and the skippers’ meeting, we organise ourselves for the start, with the boats gliding back and forth across the bay under easy sail in the bright morning sun.\nWind on the turn\nThe start horn goes off and we sheet in our sails for the short beat out of the bay. Once outside, we settle in to getting the best performance out of our boats in the light air downwind. Those boats with spinnakers fly them and the rest of us pay close attention to our steering and sail trim.\nI actually pass one of the Wayfarer dinghies, feeling good about it, only to find out later that they have neglected to raise their centreboard, which causes extra drag and slows them down.\nThe breeze begins to turn into a real wind sometime around about 1130. It occurs to me that if this is the start of the predicted stronger wind later in the afternoon, now will be a good time to eat my lunch before I get too busy. It’s a good strategy, as soon after that the wind gets stronger and I keep busy reefing the sails to reduce the area.\nArticle continues below…\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nGreat Seamanship: Ancestor – A Carriacou Sloop’s Voyage to Vancouver\nNot many years ago I was privileged to become involved with the vernacular sloops of the Windward Islands while on…\n\n\nReefing the standing lug sails that comprise Hornpipe’s rig involves dropping the whole sail into the boat, shifting the tack pennant, tying in the reef points as you come aft, then shifting the sheet to the reef clew. After that, you hoist everything back up again, haul down on the tack pennant to tighten the luff and then sheet in. It doesn’t take long, as I have the main halyard and tack pennant lead aft – perhaps two minutes.\nWhen the mizzen is up, the boat behaves very well with the main down, sitting there quietly hove-to while the mizzen and tiller look after themselves.\n\nThe author’s second boat, Fire-Drake, at Gloucester Point. Photo: c/o Alex Zimmerman\n\nRising sea state\nAs the wind increases, I first reef the mizzen and immediately the boat’s motion is more comfortable. Within 20 minutes the wind increases again to the point where I have to take the first reef in the mainsail. The boat is again more manageable but within another 20 minutes the wind rises again to the point where I need the second reef in the main.\nThe wind keeps rising until finally I drop the mizzen sail altogether. By the time I am down to just the double-reefed main in early afternoon, we have made a lot of progress across the Strait, and don’t have far to go. The wind, however, is really strong and, more to the point, the sea state is beginning to catch up to it.\nI estimate the wind to be 20 knots with gusts higher than that. We find out later that this is wrong, that the wind is in fact a steady 30 knots, gusting to at least 34, on the edge of being a gale. That is a huge amount of wind for a small open boat.\n\nHornpipe upwind in Malaspina Strait in the northern Strait of Georgia, Vancouver Island. Photo: c/o Alex Zimmerman\n\nWaves by now are routinely 4-6ft high, with occasional waves to 8ft. At the bottom of the wave troughs I can’t see over the tops. The day remains clear and sunny though, and with the sea sparkling blue in the sunshine, the foam showing bright white from the breaking waves and the snow-capped peaks on the mainland shore shining in the distance, it is irrepressibly beautiful. It is hard to feel properly apprehensive about the high wind.\nHornpipe is essentially a rowboat and, with its tucked up transom, it is a displacement hull. I find out then that the boat will in fact surf. At the top of those bigger waves, the wind strains the doubled-reefed mainsail, the rudder starts to vibrate and hum and the boat takes off, surfing on the centre part of the hull. The experience is like the scene of the parting of the Red Sea in the Cecil B DeMille movie The Ten Commandments, with a foaming wave thrown out either side, high above the gunwales.\nAfter a few seconds of this, the peak of the wave gradually slides past under the boat and the boat subsides down off the surf into the following trough. On the milder surfs, when I have time to look, the GPS routinely records peak speeds of eight knots, and once more than nine.\nI realise that I really have too much sail up and will be much better served by having only the mizzen sail up or even the mizzen with the reef in it. But I have left it too late and am afraid to let the boat lie-to while I shift masts to put up the mizzen in the centre mast position.\n\nHornpipe heading downwind the day after the big crossing to Jedediah Island.

Even without dropping the sails, I am worried about either broaching or having one of those breaking seas break on top of me from behind. This is not just a theoretical problem, as on the top of one wave in a bigger than usual gust the boat starts to turn and the wave top begins to drive it further. I haul with all my strength on the rudder and hoist myself to the high side while I watch the gunwale get closer and closer to the water and a rush of fear spikes my adrenalin.\nSomewhat shakily, I manage to get the boat back under control.\nTime loses its meaning as I focus on my steering to avoid a repeat. My world has narrowed to only water, wind, breaking waves and sunshine. Slowly, slowly the islands ahead grow larger, until finally I can distinguish the opening to Sabine Channel, between Jedediah and Texada Islands.\n\nOrcas swim between raid boats in Johnstone Strait.
