That’s a great question! When you're managing a system like BoatNetMonitor remotely, especially on a boat with potential connectivity challenges, there are several important things you can monitor and manage proactively to predict and address potential issues. Below are some areas where you can enhance the functionality of BoatNetMonitor and help prevent problems while you're away.

1. Network Health Monitoring:
Since you're using a 4G connection, the network quality might fluctuate, and you're likely relying on Wi-Fi for local devices. Here are some ideas to track network health:

Signal Strength & Connectivity:

Monitor the 4G connection strength (e.g., signal quality, signal-to-noise ratio).
Track the status of wlan0 and eth0 to detect disconnections or weak connections.
Network Throughput:

Track the upload/download speed over the 4G connection.
Alert if the speed falls below a certain threshold (indicating network issues or congestion).
Connection Uptime & Reboots:

Track uptime for both the 4G connection and Wi-Fi interfaces.
Monitor if the modem (SIM7600) or network interfaces (e.g., eth0, wlan0) frequently go down and automatically restart them.
Alert for Disconnections:

Send alerts if the 4G connection drops or if the network interface goes down.
Set up an automatic reconnect attempt if the network drops.
2. Hardware Monitoring:
Temperature & Environmental Monitoring:

If possible, track the temperature of the Raspberry Pi or other critical hardware (like the 4G HAT). Overheating could cause issues, especially in warm environments like on a boat.
Implement alerts if the temperature exceeds safe operating limits (e.g., 85°C).
Power Supply Monitoring:

Keep track of the system’s power supply, especially if you're using a battery or solar-powered system.
Set up alerts if the power supply drops below a threshold (e.g., low battery voltage), and automatically switch to a backup power source if available.
File System Monitoring:

Monitor disk space usage to avoid running out of space, especially on SSDs or USB drives where you're caching data.
Set up alerts when disk usage exceeds a certain percentage (e.g., 90%).
3. DNS and Network Configuration Issues:
Since you're manually managing the DNS and network configuration, here are some potential issues and solutions:

Check for DNS Resolution Failures:
Monitor DNS resolution to ensure that devices on the network can always resolve domain names. If DNS resolution fails, you might want to check if /etc/resolv.conf has been overwritten or if the DNS service (e.g., dnsmasq or systemd-resolved) is down.
Dynamic IP Issues:
If your boat network is dynamic (using DHCP for IP assignment), ensure that devices aren’t losing their IP address when the DHCP lease expires or if the DHCP server goes down.
Set up a lease renewal check and alert you if devices fail to renew their IP address.
4. Backup and Logging:
Automated Backups:
Set up an automated backup process for configuration files and critical data (e.g., DNS settings, network configuration) to an external server or cloud storage. This ensures that even if something goes wrong, you can restore the system easily.
Error & Event Logging:
Implement detailed logging for any network events, errors, or service failures.
Use syslog or a custom logging service to centralize logs.
Set up log monitoring to alert you when specific events (like service failures or disconnections) occur.
5. System Health Monitoring:
System Resource Usage:

Monitor CPU, RAM, and disk usage in real-time to avoid performance degradation or crashes.
Set up thresholds that, if exceeded, will trigger alerts (e.g., CPU usage > 90% or disk space > 90%).
Automated Service Restarts:

Ensure critical services (e.g., hostapd, dhclient, dnsmasq) are running and automatically restart them if they fail.
Set up a heartbeat service to monitor whether essential services like the Wi-Fi hotspot or 4G modem are active and working correctly.
6. Remote Command Execution:
Remote Access via Web Interface:
Implement a secure way to execute commands remotely via your web interface, such as restarting network services or fetching diagnostics (e.g., ifconfig, ping, dmesg).
Admin Panel:
Allow easy troubleshooting by providing access to logs and status of services via the web interface.
Provide an option to manually restart services (like hostapd for Wi-Fi) or reboot the Raspberry Pi if necessary.
7. Predictive Alerts:
Bandwidth Overuse Alerts:

If you're metering data usage, send alerts when bandwidth usage approaches the limit.
Display bandwidth usage statistics on the web interface and allow users to set limits.
Device Connection Quality:

Track the health of connected devices (e.g., devices on the Wi-Fi network) and send alerts if they are disconnecting frequently or if the signal strength is too weak.
Predictive Maintenance:

Using historical data (e.g., temperature, power, signal strength), predict potential failures (e.g., hardware overheating or data connection drops) before they happen.
You can implement this using simple thresholds or machine learning models (e.g., by tracking over time and noticing patterns of failure).
8. User Interface (UI) Enhancements:
Real-time Monitoring Dashboard:

Build a real-time dashboard that shows the status of your network, devices, and critical system metrics (e.g., 4G signal strength, Wi-Fi clients, bandwidth usage).
Include visualizations for things like signal strength, internet speed, and power status to give you an overview of your system’s health.
Interactive Troubleshooting:

Add buttons that allow you to manually trigger certain actions, such as restarting the Wi-Fi hotspot, refreshing the DNS settings, or checking connectivity with a particular device on the network.
9. Backup Internet Connection:
Failover Mechanism:
If you have a secondary internet connection (e.g., a satellite or backup 4G modem), implement a failover mechanism that automatically switches between connections if one fails.
10. Security Considerations:
Remote Access Security:
Implement authentication and encryption (e.g., HTTPS, SSH keys) to secure your remote web interface and command execution.
Set up firewall rules to block unauthorized access to the BoatNet network.
Conclusion:
By implementing proactive monitoring, automatic failover, and predictive alerts, you can significantly reduce the risk of issues while you're away on the boat. Additionally, features like remote troubleshooting, backup systems, and enhanced logging will help you quickly identify and resolve problems, ensuring that your BoatNet system operates smoothly even when you're out of reach.
